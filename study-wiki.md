Welcome to the Study Wiki!
===

This is a project designed to facilitate study of complex subjects.

For example, technical books commonly have glossaries at the end, which list (most of) the terms used throughout the book.
The wiki format, and markdown, allow for seamless "glossaries" to be embedded into the "book" itself, thus providing on-demand
access to definitions.

This project aims to achieve just that: provide complex information, while seamlessly integrating term definitions into the material itself.
