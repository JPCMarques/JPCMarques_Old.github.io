IFBCompanion is a simple app for [Runescape](https://www.runescape.com/), to aid in the grind for the "Insane Final Boss"
(IFB for short), which consists in getting 100 kills in each boss (regular and hard modes) and all their respective pets.

The application is quite straightforward: lets you pick which bosses you don't want to kill, which bosses you want to kill
more (just like a [slayer task](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Slayer_reward_point#Assignment)), and then assigns you one 
at random based on those parameters (preferred bosses have a higher chance of being picked).

The utility of this app comes from the fact that a lot of pets are quite frankly a pain in the ass to get (due to bosses 
being extremely boring, having near to zero value of drops or being straight up horrid for some people), and this app
will assign such bosses with lower probability, so that you still kill the ones you like, but don't end up with having to 
only kill said cancerous bosses (after having cleared all the requirements from the ones you like).
