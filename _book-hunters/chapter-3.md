Raynell found himself caged after attempting to absorb the Void. He could see Guardian from between the tentacles, but he couldn't seem to hear it. 

*Oh shit. Shouldn't have tried that.*

He tried removing his hands from the floor, without success. What's more, tiny tentacles began to wrap around his hands and legs, forcing him on his knees. Wherever the tentacles touched, he felt excruciating pain, but no physical damage was left upon contact. He screamed, harder and harder as the tentacles crept up his body, tortuously slow, as if the Void was attempting to torture him.

His panic, ever-growing, began to overpower him as he desperately tried to pull his arms from the floor and away from the tentacles, relentlessly approaching his shoulders and waist, causing more pain the closer they got to his chest.

He looked to the guardian with his eyes wide open, releasing some tears, as his augs began to be broken by the Void, and saw him simply standing outside the cage, facing him.

*Shit. They're almost in my face!*

*I'm going to die!*

The tentacles slowly covered his shoulders completely, and began to creep up from his waist in the direction of his heart, exponentially increasing his panic and failed attempts for freedom.

*God fucking damnit! This shit hurts like hell! And that fucker is right outside looking at me like a retard! What the fuck?!*

As the tip of the first tentacle touched his neck, he felt even more pain than he was expecting, and resigned himself to his fate.

*I can't fight this. I'm going to die an excruciating death. I'm not even going to cast a motherfucking spell after discovering I can...*

He stopped screaming. He couldn't do so anymore, as he had lost his voice from all the previous desperate screams of pain. He continued to be covered up until the chin and ribcage. At that point, the tentacles begined to combine into bigger ones: one on his chest, two on his back and three in front of his face.

He stared at them, growing for a few seconds.

*Great, now I'm going to get raped too. Fucking hell, why?!*

Instead, the tentacles suddenly stopped growing.

*What the...* - before he could finish his thought, they stabbed him, almost instantly. The one on his chest stabbed his heart, the ones on his back his shoulderblades, and the ones in front of his face went into his eyes and mouth. 

He stopped feeling any pain, at all, as the Void entered his body. He felt relieved and, at the same time, even more fearful.

*What the fuck is happening now? What is the Void doing to me?!*

The tentacles that covered his body began flowing into him where he was stabbed, along with the cage surrounding him, at such a speed that their movements could only be seen as blurs. In their wake, his clothes were completely destroyed, and pitch black tattoos appeared with an intricate, eldritch design covered most of his body.

When all of them flowed into him, he fell flat on the floor, passing out.

Guardian rushed to him, lifting him the air by creating some sort of platform out of thin air, carrying him over the portal.

<center>&diams;</center>

Guardian opened a light gray door to a pure white room, the walls seemingly emitting the gentle light that covered the room, that, due to the walls, floor and ceiling beeing completely white, and their connections indistinguishable, gave off the illusion that it was an endless scape of white, with the notable exception of the door. 

As it brought Raynell to the center of the room, the humanoid said, calmly:

"Room, create a platform for humans."

Immediately, a small circular white platform rose from the floor, only a couple of centimeters wide, mirrored by another platform protruding from the ceiling. Both progressively grew until they were slightly wider than the average human. Light blue light came out from the one in the floor, meeting the upper one and creating a hollow pillar of light. A small gust of wind was sent out of it, expelling all matter from inside of it.

The guardian placed Raynell inside the pillar. He floated until he was in the center of it. Upon reaching it, the top of the pillar opened, and several tubes of a plastic-like material and varying widths came down from the ceiling. One oxygen mask attached itself to Raynells face, several tubes with electrode-like ends convered most of his body, most of them placed on top of the full-body tattoo. One with a syringe end perfurated his right arm crook and began extracting some blood, which flowed to the ceiling through the tube.

"Show me the diagnosis."

A screen made up exclusively by light appeared in front of it, with several graphs detailing Raynell's physical condition, and a descriptive text underneath them all. It read:

*<center>Severe Void contamination. Subject has void particles inside his circulatory system, and several concentrated deposits spread throughout his body. His eyes seem to have been completely replaced by two such deposits. The three other deposits are on each of his shoulderblades, and one surrounding his heart. Most of his nerves and neurons are also partially covered by void particles. Full recovery highly unlikely, and eyesight permanently lost.</center>*

*This guy is fucked, bloody dumbass.* - Guardian said, out loud.
