Raynell found himself caged after attempting to absorb the Void. He could see Guardian from between the tentacles, but he couldn't seem to
hear it. 

*Oh shit. Shouldn't have tried that.*

He tried removing his hands from the floor, without success. What's more, tiny tentacles began to wrap around his hands and legs,
forcing him on his knees. Wherever the tentacles touched, he felt excruciating pain, but no physical damage was left upon contact. He screamed,
harder and harder as the tentacles crept up his body, tortuously slow, as if the Void was attempting to torture him.

His panic, ever-growing, began to overpower him as he desperately tried to pull his arms from the floor and away from the tentacles, relentlessly
approaching his shoulders and waist, causing more pain the closer they got to his chest.

He looked to the guardian with his eyes wide open, releasing some tears, as his augs began to be broken by the Void, and saw him simply
standing outside the cage, facing him.

*Shit. They're almost in my face!*

*I'm going to die!*

The tentacles slowly covered his shoulders completely, and began to creep up from his waist in the direction of his heart, exponentially increasing
his panic and failed attempts for freedom.

*God fucking damnit! This shit hurts like hell! And that fucker is right outside looking at me like a retard! What the fuck?!*

As the tip of the first tentacle touched his neck, he felt even more pain than he was expecting, and resigned himself to his fate.

*I can't fight this. I'm going to die an excruciating death. I'm not even going to cast a motherfucking spell after discovering I can...*

He stopped screaming. He couldn't do so anymore, as he had lost his voice from all the previous desperate screams of pain. He continued to be covered
up until the chin and ribcage. At that point, the tentacles begined to combine into bigger ones: one on his chest, two on his back and three in front
of his face.

He stared at them, growing for a few seconds.

*Great, now I'm going to get raped too. Fucking hell, why?!*

Instead, the tentacles suddenly stopped growing.

*What the...* - before he could finish his thought, they stabbed him, almost instantly. The one on his chest stabbed his heart, the ones on 
his back his shoulderblades, and the ones in front of his face went into his eyes and mouth. 

He stopped feeling any pain, at all, as the Void entered his body. He felt relieved and, at the same time, even more fearful.

*What the fuck is happening now? What is the Void doing to me?!*

The tentacles that covered his body began flowing into him where he was stabbed, along with the cage surrounding him, at such a speed that their
movements could only be seen as blurs. In their wake, his clothes were completely destroyed, and pitch black tattoos appeared with an intricate, eldritch
design covered most of his body.

When all of them flowed into him, he fell flat on the floor, passing out.

Guardian rushed to him, lifting him the air by creating some sort of platform out of thin air, carrying him over the portal.
