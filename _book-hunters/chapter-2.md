  As he regained consciousness, becoming aware of his blank surroundings, the pain slowly faded away, giving way to
  an overwhelming sense of terror. He was alone in a boundless, black void. He wasn't falling; he could walk around and maintain a
  foothold, despite the onyx black of the apparent floor being the same as the one that surrounded him.

  In front of him, appeared the antropomorphic manifestation of energy.

  "Where am I?"

  "You are on of the very few to ever come here. What you are bearing witness to is the end."

  With even more terror creeping on him, he asked, reluctantly - "What do you mean?"

  "This is a place where all the dead go to. Be it gods, men, women or children, every single living thing ends up here."

  "What the fuck?"

  "This is the place that borned all things, that devours all things, existing beyond time. This is your trial. Devoid of all religious dogma, facing the eldritch horror
  of nothingness, your inevitable destination, regardless of what you accomplish, who you kill, who you save, you must decide. What do you want to do?"

  "Holy fucking shit. No fucking way."

  "Calm down, human."

  "Calm down? How in the fucking FUCK do you expect me to do that huh?!"

  "Are you religious in any way?"

  "No?"

  "Good, then this will be easier for you."

  "How come?" - Raynell was visibly angrier at the calm and collected thing in front of him

  "Because you already knew of this, at least on subconscious level."

  "What."

  "If you don't believe in a higher power, in life after death, then you must surely believe that after you die, you're dead. Like, dead dead." - it said, in a condescending tone one can
  commonly found in a kindergarten teacher.

  "This is different!"

  "Of course this is different! Before, you believed. Now you know its the soul-crushing truth, without *any* possibility of reincarnation or some sort of afterlife. No cowardly safety net."

  "I.." -- he paused for a bit, collecting his thoughts -- "Yeah, you're right. Though I have to ask, what about religion? Is there any grain of truth to it."

  "Yeah, most of it is true. For all religions."

  "I'm even more confused."

  "What are you to an ant, if not a god? A being with seemingly omnipotence and what you perceive as omniscience. Anything on a whole different dimension than you can be called a god. Power
  is relative."

  "To you, creating life is impossible, and creating machines to augment yourself is a completely trivial matter. Yet, for a *lesser* being like an ant its way beyond what an alien concept is.
  Hell, even some centuries ago you humans didn't even fathom the concept of a machine! What is to say that there isn't a being higher than you, capable of alien things such as the creation of
  life, that created you? That taught you?"

  "Didn't this place give birth to everything?"

  "Yes. Regardless of it being triggered by a "god", sex, or any other creation, you are completely made up of the Void, this place, as we like to call it. Everything that is or ever will be is
  here. Now, enough chit-chat. Decide. What do you want to do?"

  "I want to consume it. I will make the Void my bitch."

  Flabergasted, the energy asked, "What?"

  "You just said that "gods" channeled the Void to create life. Its not that much of stretch to assume that they also did so to become *de facto* immortal. I will become powerful enough to be a
  god, and when I eventually become strong enough to dissociate myself from the Void, I will become a *true* god"

  "Hahahaha... That is surely unique. Very well, I believe you have the makings of a strong book hunter." - it waved its hand, and Raynell was gone.

  Cracks began to form all over the Void, emitting bright white light.

  "Maybe too strong..." it said to itself, before teleporting itself back to the library.

  <center>&diams;</center>

  Back in the library, Raynell was slowly regaining consciousness. He was in a different room than before, this one small, 10 to 15 meters wide, with mostly empty bookshelves, with the notable
  exception of the book he was handed, now placed on top of a pedestal in the middle of the room.

  "Where am I?"

  "This is the inner sanctum of this library. The place where only book hunters, such as yourself, or its guardian, me, can enter, where the books with Void Traces are kept."

  Raynell stared blankly at the Guardian, waiting for it to continue its explanation.

  "Right, you're new. Sorry, been a while since there was someone here. Void traces are, in a nutshell, an instruction manual to manipulate the void in a specific way."
