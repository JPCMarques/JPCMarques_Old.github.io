When he came to, Raynell was in a seemingly infinite, pitch black room. In front of him,
was the amalgamation of energy resembling a humanoid creature.

"Welcome to the Void. This is a place that breaks most human beings, specially the religious.
This is where you come from, and where you will ultimately go to. The essence of all things and,
ultimately, their demise."

"...What?"

"When someone is born, they are shaped by whatever method of conceival of their species, to
transform from the miniscule portion of the Void that they are, into the miniscule being that is born.
At your core, there is nothing and yet, everything. But, eventually, this place will claim them and
they will return to it."

"Nothing? But I have beliefs, dreams, goals, enemies, loved ones..."

"If you think about it, there is nothing at the core of those beliefs and emotions.
They are the consequence of the collective consciousness you call a society, and of
themselves. One such example are your enemies and loved ones. They are, ultimately,
a consequence of your own actions, which are ultimately consequences of previous actions, ultimately
influenced by your societal laws, which are ultimately consequences of your collective actions, stemming
ultimately from nothing, at all. And that's what makes Life beautiful. You build, from nothing,
these mechanisms to derive meaning from meaningless things, that is ultimately empty and void."

The humanoid remained in the same position throughout the whole speech, instilling a sense of
primal fear in Raynell, aggrevated by what it said.
medieval time
"So everything is pointless?! Everything I had to endure in my life, had no meaning?"

"That's for you to decide, as you are the only one who can draw meaning from your life."

"What about gods then, don't they surpass that?"

"There are *no* gods, only beings whose *power* you can't comprehend, analogous to taking a ship to the medieval times.
Those primitive humans would probably revere you as a god. Now that's a funny thing with conscious beings - if you see
something you can't comprehend, you see it as godly and worship it as so. If, however, it is within the realm of fantasy,
like flying, making flowers bloom, creating fire and water from nothing, you brand them as either heroes or monsters. You
humans are a notable example of this. You see this guy walk on water and kill his clone, and most of the bloody planet worships
him as God for a couple thousand years. Yet, you see people healing others, possess super-human strength and burn them at the stake.
But, eventually, the beings you call gods too must die, and return here, paying the price of life."

Befuddled by the revelations, he just stood there, looking apathetically at the humanoid.

"This will be your test. Stay here and return to the Void, or choose to continue to live."

Realizing his meaningless, Raynell asked:

"Whats the point thought?" - his crushed morale could be heard clearly from the tone of his voice.

"There is none. Life is pointless and no one will spoonfeed you meaning, you have to carve that meaning for yourself. That's why
the eon old question of "What's the meaning of life?" has never had a consensual answer - everyone has a different true answer."

Feeling even more crushed at the absence of meaning in his existance, he dropped to his knees, giving no answer to the humanoid.

"I see you've made your choice" -  it said, before turning around and creating a portal - "Goodbye."

As it was about to go through the portal, Raynell almost jumped, yelling - "Wait!"

Slightly turning its head around, the amalgamation calmly asked - "Yes? What is it?"

"How are Book Hunters magicians? How do they perform magic? And how are they different from "gods"?"

"What?"

"Well, I take it that shifting me to another dimension isn't exactly obeying the laws of physics. And since you're made up of
pure energy, it's not that far-fetched to claim that you are a Book Hunter, the creation of one, or perhaps one of the beings
one might call "god"."

"And? What of it?"

"Since you said that the Void is everything that was, is, and will ever be, my theory is that Book Hunters, or magicians, or
whatever the fuck you want to call them, channel it to "cast spells" and surpass the laws of physics."

"That is correct."

"However, I can't believe that the Void created everything."

"Why's that?"

"Well, let's assume the following scenario. Before there was anything, there was only Void, right? So, that it implies that it,
if it could even achieve a consciousness, couldn't have known what the concept of life was, or even matter beyond itself for that
matter, therefore not being able to create it, even if it had the capability to. So, if there was only Void before everything, there
most certainly was something before the Void. My guess is, there was, at some point, a being that created life *through* the Void."

A moment of silence fell in the endless room.

"There's a higher being isn't there?" - he continued - "The Void is just an ocean to us fishes, unaware that there is land and sky beyond it."

The humanoid began laughing jovialy.

"That's a fine theory, but that's all it is. No one knows for sure how life began, or how it will end. I can't possibly answer your
question with absolute certainty, as that is one question for which the answer remains unknown to this day."

"That is my answer then. I will find my creator, or prove I have none."

"That is a good purpose, that many have had, and even more see it as a fool's errand. Besides, it's not like purposes are *always* permanent.
I accept your answer. Welcome to the Book Hunters! My name is Guardian, an artifial being made to protect the Sanctum you so carelessly walked into,
and a *de facto* butler for the Book Hunters inside it. Now, come on, maintaining this portal isn't exactly easy."

"Cool. But first, allow me to try something out."

"What?"

Raynell placed his hands on the ground - "To consume the Void." - he began imagining the Void flowing into him, through his hands and to himself.

"NO! STOP!" - it began to fly towards Raynell

Just as Guardian finished yelling, black tentacle-like things formed a circle around Raynell, undulating and growing in size, their tips moving towards
a point above his head, until they finally enveloped Raynell in a cage.
