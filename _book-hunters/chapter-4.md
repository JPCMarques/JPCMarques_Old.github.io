The door in the room opened, and Guardian rushed in.

"I see you're awake. Please refrain from attempting to speak, as I won't be able to understand what you say from underneath that mask."

Although Raynell could see Guardian perfectly, everything else seemed blurry, as if out of focus.

"*Fuck you, sparkles! Yeah you shut up!* Help me... *We told you already, no one can help you now...* Why is everything blurry? *Maybe because you're blind you moronic dimwit? How can he be blind but still see? He could be nearly blind? Ah yeah.* And can you shut these up? *Screw you dude! Yeah, you shut up!*"

"You've assimilited a portion of the Void. That portion of the void is part of your body now, having replaced all artificial enhancements you had with raw, physical Void, bound to you and taking the form of your original body parts. Unfortunately that means that, since your eyes were completely artificial, they were completely replaced by Void, which caused your eyesight to become... non-existant."

Before Raynell could interrupt him, the guarding continued his explanation.

"I know you can still see me. That's because, having absorbed so much Void, you developed the ability to sense Void energy. You seeing me is merely your body attempting to interpret the new sense you've been given. As for the voices that have been speaking in your stead, they are your mind's interpretation of the Void."

"What the fuck? *Going to have to agree with him on this one. Yup.*"

"Once you absorbed the Void, you were confronted with a paradox: you had just absorbed finite infinite raw energy. To add to the paradox, you absorbed something seemingly limited physically, but still infinite. As such, you were driven to madness: you are interpreting the Void that is currently part of your body and coursing through your veins as all versions of you, a condition you could see as mix of schyzophrenia and multiple personality disorder, as you see and hear imaginary people, but they're consciously manifested as alternate personalities."

"So I'm not actually insane? *Don't get all hopeful, kid. You ain't going to get rid of us that easy.*"

"Technically, no. However, unless your mind can find another way to interpret the Void, you might as well be. On the brightside, only your *real* personality can control your body, so not all is bad. Physically, you're more than fine, having pure Void as body parts, and running through your veins, that means those body parts can't really die, and it gives you a much bigger pool of energy to manipulate."

Raynell forced a smile. Amidst the maddening whispers he would constantly hear in his head, he was attempting to formulate a plan to deal with the personalities. His head pointed to the floor he could not touch, he let himself remain in that position.

Guardian brought up a monitor to its right. It read:

*<center>VOID CONTAMINATION</center>*

*<center>Over 40% of the subject's body are comprised entirely of Void energy. Lack of control can lead to massive damage to surroundings. Suggested course of action: termination.</center>*

Looking at the floating man in front of him, Guardian couldn't help but feel sorry for him.

*I really should kill him, to prevent any adverse effects to the Sanctuary... But he's the only Void Hunter we've had for a long time...*

It looked at Raynell, into the pitch black balls that were now his eyes, and couldn't bring himself to kill him.

*I guess I'll just keep an eye on him for the time being. Should he become a threat, I will terminate him.*

"Listen, Raynell. The voices are the least of your worries. We've found ways to deal with those issues a long time ago, as many of our Book Hunters over time had some sort of schyzophrenia. The real issue is the sheer amount of raw Void energy you possess."

He looked puzzled, slightly tilting his head to one side.

"How so?" - the voices remained quiet this time, possibly out of fear of the creature that could remove them.

"Void Manipulation is something that is made instinctively. Say you wanted to protect yourself and covered your head with your arms. If you were a normal human being, that is, not a Book Hunter, that would be the end of it. However, since you *are* one, and possess such a tremendous amount of Void in you, you will probably lash out with Void energy manifestated in some form."

It pawsed, gauging his reaction.

"To make matters worse, due to your extreme amount of Void energy, and how it replaced your arms and legs, you won't have any control over the strength you exert. That could lead to you either failing to move, or doing so with too much strength."

Raynell said nothing.

"You will have to go through physiotherapy. and learn how to control the Void properly. For the time being, I will give you a moving aid made of Void - it attaches to your brain and makes your body move accordingly."

"Thanks. *None of us want a body to possess that can't even move*. OH MY GOD SHUT UP! *Yeaaaah... no. Try and make us.*" - Raynell went silent - "*Thought so. Sparkles, give the man some crutches already, will ya?*"

Guardian chuckled a little, before extending its right arm, a small ball of lightning emerging from it, as if removed from the body itself, moving towards Raynell.

Raynell panicked a little as he saw the tiny ball of lightning heading towards him.

"Is that going to hurt? *What? Little Rayray is scared? Boohoo...*"

The guardian chuckled once again, before answering the question.

"No. You will, however, feel unconfortable, as it will envelop your whole body. Worry not, for it is transparent for you and everyone else, and it wont stop anything from going through it. It only stimulates your body so it moves the way you want. It won't move in a way that it would not be able to; for example, you won't be able to bend your arms backward. This was a safety measure put in place so people wouldn't kill themselves with this thing."

As it finished the explanation, the ball touched Raynell's chest, and began flattening on it. Once fully flat, it spreaded through its body in a manner similar to the roots of a tree, the roots then expanded until they fully covered him, becoming transparent. Guardian then lowered his right arm.

"You said this would be transparent right? I'm fairly certain that its not, at least not to my Void Sight, although the low Void density allows me to see everything blurred out. Could you possibly make a couple of holes so that I could actually see through it?"

"Oh right, almost forgot about that." - it extended its right arm again, causing two holes to appear in Raynell's face.

"Thanks."

"Alright, try and move your body a little, see if it worked."

He pulled both his hands towards his chest, and crossed them. He then moved his knees towards his chest, then back to their resting position. He turned his face in a "no" motion, and wiggled his hips a little.

"Yeah everything seems fine."

"Good. I will lower you from there, and remove the barrier surrounding you."

All the cables and the oxygen mask detached from his body, and he floated down until he stood on the floor, while the cables returned to their storage space in the ceiling.

"Before I remove the barrier I will give you a fair warning. Don't forget that what I did to you only controls the way you move, not the strength you exert to do so. As such, please be careful not to break anything. Though I'm fairly certain you will hit this wall behind me."

"Uh? *what the hell, Sparkles? Why would we hit it?*"

"You'll see. Alright, I'm lowering the barrier now." - as quickly as it went up, the barrier came down, as if a curtain, falling on the floor. - "Try and take a step forward."

Raynell took a step forward, successfully placing his right foot where intended.

"HA! Didn't hit the wall."

"Don't get cocky. Take another step."

The moment Raynell lifted his left foot, he threw himself into the wall, almost instantly, as if he had teleported there, creating a current of wind from his sudden movement, and sliding to the floor from the wall.

The wall was not damaged, not even a little, and Raynell did not feel pain, despite the force he hit it with. 

"What the fuck? *Gonna have to agree with him on this one, what the fuck just happened?!*"

"I told you you'd hit the wall. Its due to your suddenly enhanced strength, that you can't fully control so far."

"So I'm just going to crash into walls the moment I decide to move?!."

"No. These walls are made of a shock-absorbant material we created, and are the perfect training ground for you." - *and containment unit*, Guardian thought - "Just try to exert as little strength as possible. Imagine you're walking on a floor made of paper, and any sudden movement will make it tear apart underneath you."

"Here goes..."

2 hours passed since Raynell went into the library. Dean and LL were starting to get nervous.

"What happened to him? He should have returned by now." - LL said.

"Damned if I know. Just call him on the comms?"

"I did. All I got back was static."

Dean began to show a worried face.

"Maybe he's simply too far away, don't worry too much about it."

"Even still, I think we should go look for him."

"No way, man. We need to watch the entrance for other scavs. He's stronger than both of us combined anyways, with all those augs."

"I guess you're right. I can't help but worry though."

A moment of silence fell between the two. Dean interrupted that moment of silence, saying:

"You know he's not into you right?"

The question was met with a swift response by LL, in the form of a punch in the shoulder.

<center>&diams;</center>

"Yes! I can now walk properly again! *The light of our Lord shone upon you, and thusly allowed you to move.* *Holy shit, we have a preacher here! What's up dude! Language, my son. Buzzkill.*" - he couldn't help but exhibit a confident smile.

"See, it wasn't too hard."

"Yeah. What about my friends?"

"Who?"

"The two numbskulls that I left at the entrance."

"Oh, they're still there."

"Can you take me there?"

"I strongly advise against that, you still can't control your powers."

"I got to tell them I'm fine, or pretty soon they will come after me."

"It's up to you. I'm just adivsing you."

"Very well. Show me around this place, and then take me to them."
