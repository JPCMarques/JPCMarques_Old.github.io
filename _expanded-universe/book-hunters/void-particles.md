## Definition

Void Particles are the building blocks of any inorganic matter. It is often referred to as "solid void". Infusing these particles, or their resulting product (matter), with void energy[^1] results in its animation[^2]. This can range from basic telekinesis, to creating automata, with varying degrees of intelligence.

Despite void energy being able to behave as void particles, particles can't behave as energy: the only manipulations that can be made with particles are altering the matter's molecular composition - that which more primitive civilizations often call "alchemy", "matter shifting" or some other variant - or their positions, *en masse*, known as terraforming. Void energy can be used to easen this process, although it is not absolutely needed. For both of them, the higher the areas affected, the more difficult it is to perform; even to a basic extent, it requires an understanding of the Void that most low level manipulators often can't grasp.

Both manipulations can be combined into Alchemical Terraforming, which is a process that is hardly ever practiced due to its extreme difficulty to even start practicing it.

## Alchemy

Despite being a name used by primitive civilizations, its simplicity stuck with manipulators and became the *de facto* official name for altering the molecular composition of matter (much easier to say too).

It has two schools: temporary and permanent alchemy.

Temporary automatically reverts the material to its original form after its been altered. This is often used in combat, due to its versatility, and relatively low difficulty when compared to permanent alchemy, allowing the manipulator to focus on the battle itself, rather than focusing on the alchemy process and dying due to distraction.

A common example of temporary battle alchemy is "half-way" alchemy, used to counter regular alchemy, or simply temporarily "destroying" the battlefield. Its based on making the matter transform into particles, which after a while reverts back to its original form. Imagine someone threw a spear at a manipulator that practices half-way alchemy. The manipulator could simply destroy the spear and fully negate the attack.
