## Definition

Void Particles are the building blocks of any non-living matter (do note, however, that undead beings aren't included in this definition). It is often referred to as "solid void". Infusing these particles, or their resulting product (matter), with void energy[^1] results in its animation[^2]. This can range from basic telekinesis, to creating automata, with varying degrees of intelligence.

Despite void energy being able to behave as void particles, particles can't behave as energy: the only manipulations that can be made with particles are altering the matter's molecular composition - that which more primitive civilizations often call "alchemy", "matter shifting" or some other variant - or their positions, *en masse*, known as terraforming. Void energy can be used to easen this process, although it is not absolutely needed. For both of them, the higher the areas affected, the more difficult it is to perform; even to a basic extent, it requires an understanding of the Void that most low level manipulators often can't grasp.

Both manipulations can be combined into Alchemical Terraforming, which is a process that is hardly ever practiced due to its extreme difficulty to even start practicing it.

## Alchemy

Despite being a name used by primitive civilizations, its simplicity stuck with manipulators and became the *de facto* official name for altering the molecular composition of matter (much easier to say too). Alchemical difficulty scales with the density of the material and atomic number of the materials being alchemized (be they source, or destination), exponentially.

It has two schools: temporary and permanent alchemy.

### Temporary Alchemy

Automatically reverts the material to its original form after its been altered. This is often used in combat, due to its versatility, and relatively low difficulty when compared to permanent alchemy, allowing the manipulator to focus on the battle itself, rather than focusing on the alchemy process and dying due to distraction.

A common example of temporary battle alchemy is "half-way" alchemy, used to counter regular alchemy, or simply temporarily "destroying" the battlefield. Its based on making the matter transform into particles, which after a while reverts back to its original form. Imagine someone threw a spear at a manipulator that practices half-way alchemy. The manipulator could simply destroy the spear and fully negate the attack.

This can be one of the most damaging forms of alchemy, as it simply erases all non-living matter from existence (should the manipulator be powerful enough to do so).

That, however, is simply the tip of the iceberg. One of the most valuable uses of temporary alchemy is chemical reaction recycling, in particular fuel recycling. Normally, when burning fuel, both energy and waste is produced. Skilled alchemists can, from waste, transform it back into the fuel source, infinitely repeating this cycle until his energy is depleted, which is much easier and resource-efficient to restore. The only "waste" in the process is the dissipated heat, but even that can be re-purposed in some manner or the other.

One account of the efficiency of temporary alchemy, as well as on of the earliest, comes from a post human apocalyptic companion to a manipulator, as follows:

> <bqh>Day 781</bqh>

> A man came to us in the middle of a blizzard. He did not seem to shiver with cold, despite being topless. He did not speak, and we could not determine if he was mute, retarded, or just a plain cunt. Our food supplies are running low, so we might not be able to sustain him. He'd make a fine food source though, if we can manage to kill him. He seems to be well muscled, so much more than our scrawny asses - maybe if we team up.

> <bqh>Day 782</bqh>

> The strangest thing happened. Once we all started eating our rationed leather, we attempted to share with him, see if we could gain his trust. He did not budge, and instead got up, and walked away. We were all confused, but we did not have the energy to leave the small shelter of the cave to hunt him, so we just looked at eachother and watched him fade into the blizzard.

> A few hours later, in the dead of night, he returned, pulling a bear with just one hand - yes I know this sounds insane, but it gets worse, real fast - on his other hand, he held some wooden sticks, that seemed to be dry. Now that's the thing, where in the bloody fucking hell does he get dry wood in the middle of a motherfucking blizzard? Whatever. Good food and heat, what else can a man want right?

> Now, how would he light the fire? Well, he fucking threw the wood on the cave's (relatively) dry ground and it just spontaneously combusted. Yeah. I mean, we were malnourished and shit, but that ain't no goddamn allucination. At that moment, we unanimously decided with simple looks that we shouldn't ever try to hurt that man.

> We then watched him quite literally dismember the thing, by just pulling it apart! Like, what the hell is he? After the bear was split into more manageable chunks, it too spontaneously combusted. Im thoroughly confused, but at this point my mouth is watering at the thought of cooked meat - sure beats raw dead human.

> And yet, he still didn't eat, not even a bit.

> We went to sleep, with our bellies full, like we had never been before.

> <bqh>Day 783</bqh>

> When we woke up, he was no longer among us. He had left, as abruptly as he arrived, but the flame kept burning, as if the wood had never turned into ash. We noticed a peculiar thing about the bonfire. The number of sticks was 5 - the same number as us.

> We each grabbed one end of the stick that wasn't burning, which was inexpectedly cold while the flame blazed bright and warm. I tested mine by putting it in the middle of the blizzard, but it never even showed signs of dying out - bloody cunt left us some magical torches!

> <bqh>Day 3400ish?</bqh>

> God, how nostalgic this diary is. After the man left, we never saw him again, but the five of us managed to create a small society that grew over the years to become one of the very few blizzard villages, thanks to the power of the ever-burning torches, that served both as heating, and as a flame source (god damn those were rare as hell when I started writing this journal).

> Today marks the day when we all split each other in all directions, with me (the most sickly) staying here, while the others attempt to form another villages somewhere different, each armed with one of the torches and couple of men (and women, if not for love then for breeding), seeing if they can find more humans. The doctor gave me only a couple of days to live, and probably my last good memory is of my best friends leaving me to expand our community. Hopefully I'll see them again.

> <bqh>Day 3400ish? + 1 </bqh>

> I guess I'll make another entry, for this is a special one. Today I saw the strange man, as I laid resting. He came to me and kneeled, looking into my eyes with a smile for a few minutes, and then left.

> I can't help but smile, while I feel my strength leaving me, knowing my death is near.

> Carry on my sons, carry on our torches.

In this example, it also showed that there is no need for the manipulator to be near that which is being manipulated, just when they first start manipulating. The flames themselves were different than usual, but that is another topic.

### Permanent alchemy

Permanent alchemy is a much more difficult process than temporary alchemy. It implies that the materials are not reversed into their original forms (without further alchemy). This requires a stable Void Mesh (structure of the void particles, before they are alchemized) to be made, which must match the resulting product's atomic structure (the material before is irrelevant; after being transformed into void particles, the structure can be freely altered).

That obviously makes *perfect* permanent alchemy almost impossible, and most of the more complex materials have never been successfully alchemized to perfection. The more imperfections the Mesh has before being transformed, the shorter the time period it will remain at the intended state.

To be completely correct, most "permanent" alchemizations are temporary, but their decay rate is so slow that they are *de facto* permanent.

For these reasons, an alchemist that can achieve perfect alchemizations, even if of simpler components, always has a position of high prestige in their community.

Due to the time investment needed to practice permanent alchemy, it normally specializes in equipment for manipulators, specially in those that can be infused[^2] efficiently - these require the presence of Primal Elements[^3], which are extremely difficult to produce - even for master alchemists.

A very famous example of an extremely strong weapon with an abnormaly high amount of Primal Elements is Excalibur, the sword of legends. It was infused the light Primal Element, thus giving it the nickname of "Holy Sword". Its power was so overwhelming that it allowed one man to massacre entire armies and rule as a tyrant. In the account of one of his companions:

> <center>To whoever can read this</center>

> This is my testimony, as a High Alchemist. I have seen my best friend go from an idealistic idiot, to a corrupted ruler. I helped him make up for his abhoring lack of Void Energy, by crafting him the best sword I ever did, Excalibur.

> At first, he used it sparsely to win wars by merely unleashing its power at the air, forcing the enemies into submition at his (its) sheer power. He used it to form Camelot, a kingdom of equality and utopic principles. But, as he grew tired of indulging in carnal pleasures all day, leaving his kingdom to my rule, he grew greedy.

> He started seeing the neighbouring countries, our trade allies, a *status quo* that took YEARS to establish, as targets of expansion. Which would be fine (ish), had he attempted to do so peacefully. But no. He literally took out his sword, MY SWORD, and just swung it at the capitals, splitting them in two and forcing them into submission. Those that didn't... well, they were towns no more.

> He held my wife and children captive and forced me to create another equipment for him - a crown, that negated attacks towards him. He also forced me to write the chronicles of his "conquest" as if he was a just conqueror - something I did while almost puking at my own words.

> Little does he know, that the crown I made is set to accumulate energy unleashed by the sword into itself, forcing it to explode the next time he uses the sword, destroying my wretched creations. I hope Morgana will forgive me. I won't be able to see her rose-colored cheeks, and her bewitching smile ever again in my life, if she's even alive. Nor will she be able to see me, for today I end my life.

> Forgive me for my sword. Forgive me for my mistakes. Forgive me, my love.

This is a prime example of a permanent alchemist. They normally can create overwhelming weapons and armour, but are incapable in combat. This is a stereotype for most alchemists: permanents are crafters, temporaries are battlers.
