Primal Elements are not "elements" at all, from a physics standpoint. They are essentially Void Meshes, of a substance that is undergoing a certain reaction. In other words, they are snapshots of physical and chemical reactions, and allow the manipulator to manifestate the substance in the state it was "meshed" instantly, only having to use void particles to do so. 

This makes Primal Elements extremely valuable, due to enabling even the weakest manipulator to exhibit overwhelming power, with minimal expenditure of their own energy (the energy required is that of manifestating the particles, in case the manipulator does not want to use his surroundings.). The effect is only magnified by the power of the manipulator - becoming even more godlike existances when equipped with Primal Elements.

However, their creation is extremely difficult and most alchemical masters that do achieve that level do not pass on their knowledge in books and even when they do, the difficulty is so overwhelming that most people don't understand them anyway. As such, any alchemist that can create *any* primal element is revered among manipulators.

Do note that, due to in essence being just Void meshes, they can still decay, and their perfection influences their worth(lessness).

Examples of their application include:

- Generation of rare materials 
- Weapons and Armour (Soul Objects[^1] usually have *some* Primal Elements)
- Food generation
