## Definition

Void energy is the base resource for Void Manipulation[^1] each living being possesses, regardless of being a manipulator or not. Manipulators, through their knowledge of the Void, as well as training, can grow their pools of energy, to the limit of their lifepans. The only things that can block one's understanding of the Void is death, mental blocks or just plain lack of understanding.

Void energy differs from Void Particles[^2] due to two factors alone:

- Particles are purely physical, while energy can also be made into elements.

  Saying that energy can be made into elements is over-simplifying it. In reality can directly produce the result of chemical/physical reactions without the need of injecting energy into matter. For example, with energy, one can create a ball of fire, even though there is nothing to burn. This would be impossible with particles, although with particles one could manifestate the material to be burnt.

 - Void particles can be created as a result of too dense manifestations of energy, and are only naturally occurring on physical matter, such as rocks.

Void energy does not have to be transformed in order to be used. It can be manifestated as raw energy, and overpower the enemy by achieving a transfer rate higher than it is capable of handling. However, it goes both ways; energy can also be absorbed, up to the individual's limit. Past that point, void contamination[^3] can occur and, in some cases, one can be fully consumed by the energy, not leaving even one speck of dust. This is a dangerous process for both parties: one is obviously dead; the other, has the energy of its enemy merge with its own and, if it overpowers him, the same process can occur and both parties will be dead. Of course, all this can be avoided, by simply getting away from the energy, waiting for it dissipate, and detach the extra energy from oneself - a process extremely difficult to do while absorbing it at the same time.

For this reason, battles among manipulators using only raw energy are extremely rare, as it can easily weaken, and remove power, from either manipulator. This is easily avoided by transforming the energy, which allows it to return to its "owner" once dissipated.

This is self-evident to any combat manipulator, as seen in the *Tenets of Combat*, by an unknown writer.

> Never fight another manipulator, regardless of their race, sex, and/or species. Such is the behaviour of primitive beings, and we should strive for a better society than those that preceeded us.

> If you have to fight another manipulator, never, ever, use your raw energy. Should they be more skilled in manipulation than you, all you're doing is gifting them energy, while weakening yourself.

> Only use raw energy if you are certain you can overpower the enemy.

> Always hide your power so that other manipulators can give you free energy.

> Calmly analyze the enemy's manipulation, and try to detect the elements they are more confortable with, to respond with an element better suited for the battle.

> Avoid over-specializing in a specific combat form. This makes you predictable and easily countered.

> Always attempt a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

> Always be prepared for fake peaceful resolutions.

> Don't deal fatal damage to any manipulator.

> Always respond swiftly, decisively and fatally to any attacking force, unless in duels or spars.
