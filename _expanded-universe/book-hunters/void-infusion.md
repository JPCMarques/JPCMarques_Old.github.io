## Definition

Void Infusion is based on using Void Energy to animate matter at will of the animator. It is based on interweaving energy with the matter, and interact with it - ranging from simple telekinesis, to creating autonomous beings.

It is devised in four levels, based on the autonomy of the infusion, as well as difficulty:

- Non-autonomous
- Non-intelligent autonomy
- Bounded autonomy
- Full autonomy

### Non-autonomous

This classifies any simple infusion based on the direct control of matter - this requires the highest sustained focus, as it must be maintained throughout the intended duration of the infusion - for more complex reactions, loss of focus in the infusion can cause it to fall apart, which can be lethal, specially in combat and volatile infusions. This can be intentional, however, particularly in combat situations.

As such, non-autonomous infusion can be devided in two further categories:

- **Destructive infusion**

  Based on infusing matter with the intent of having it destroyed - this ranges from deconstructing matter, to causing it to explode.

- **Constructive infusion**

  Based on strengthening matter for a specific purpose, such as hardening, weakening it or awakening the Primal Elements[^1] it may contain. Primal elements are exceptionally susceptible to infusion, and usually carry some sort of elemental effect.

### Non-intelligent autonomy

These are infusions that, based on energy infused, are autonomous for an amount of time proportional to that of the energy infused (as well as its expenditure of said energy), without any intelligence - these would follow orders literally, as they cannot rationalize beyond basic instructions. Examples include:

- Missiles
- Simple servants
- Autonomous swords

Due to their nature, these are usually temporary, with notable exceptions including automatic defense turrets. They can also be called reactive infusions, as they only react to external stimuli.

### Bounded autonomy

Based on creating sentient, living beings, permanently, with bounds - which can range from "you cannot leave X area", to "you can only say potato". The limitations are completely up to the infuser, and can include limited lifespan. However, once the infusion is completed (when there is no more energy interacting with the target), these cannot be reverted, nor can they be forcefully terminated. Common examples include servant entities, guardians, or advisors.

Some less common examples include Soul Objects[^2]: objects that are given sentience, usually also being a creation of alchemy, to have control of their own power - this implies that, should they wish for it, they will behave like regular objects; on the other hand, they can also autonomously act, being a *de facto* companion for the manipulator.

### Full autonomy

The rarest form of infusion, and obviously the most difficult, it is basicly creation of life - a full autonomous being, without any limitations. This is only theorized as a potential level of infusion, as no one was ever capable of successfuly performing it - resulting in either mangled aberrations, begging to be killed, or giving up mid-process and placing a limit, in order not to fail.

It is also theorized that current existing living organisms are the failed result of full autonomy infusion, as death can be seen as the ultimate limitation - which all beings share, albeit to different extents.
