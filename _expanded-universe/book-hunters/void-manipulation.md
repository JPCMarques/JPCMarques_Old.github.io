## Definition

Void Manipulation refers to any sort of usage of Void energy[^1] or particles[^2] to fit a manipulator's needs. Contrary to popular belief, this does not require an intelligent life form; Some animals, when exposed to Void particles, naturally absorb the particles and make them their own (over extended periods of time, some times years). Furthermore, animals possessing Void energy (more than the regular, expected amount), can develop intelligence, some to the point of being on par with rational species of animals.

The following is an extract from one of the field journals of Artemis, the huntress.

> I have been tracking this manipulator beast for days, and it doesn't seem to have detected me. Not sure if this is a testament to my skills, or to the retardedness of the beast. I have a kept a shroud[^3] up at all times, to prevent detection by stronger beasts.

> The beast seems to be going to a specific place, rather than walking around guarding its territory. Maybe I'll get lucky and find a nest. Fingers crossed!

> This is... something else. The beast led me to a civilization of other Void beasts. It is fortified (who knows how) and seems to have a solid, clearly defined hierarchy of power. From what I could gather through mere observation, the superior's orders are absolute but, should one choose to rise in the ranks, one must kill or defeat one beast that occupies that position. I have yet to see the ruler of this place.

> These findings are incredible. I was detected by one of their scouts (just having them is already a testament to the beasts' ruler intellect), which almost immediately summoned the ruelr to my location. It was a bird of some sort (its original form was indistinguishable due to the void energy it emmited), bigger than me and, putting aside its intimidating looks, what surprised me the most was it capability to speak perfectly, as well as rationalize in a way that isn't expected of a beast. It told me it could easily defeat me (and showed me, by instantly destroying a large portion of the forest and just as fast rebuilding it), but that it would rather not risk the life of its people and would allow me to leave, should I not show any form of aggression towards the settlement.

> These findings are game-changing. I must take these to my superiors, hope they don't think I'm going insane, and that they will erradicate this ungodly settlement. 

To manipulate the Void is an instictive activity. It is a manifestation of one's own energy and, as such, cannot be *completely* rationalized. Of course, to achieve higher levels of manipulation, one must study his own manipulation style and discover how to further improve it. This comes with an unfortunate side effect. Traditional manipulation limits the user's skills to a limited few, as these have to be instictive for the user to manifestate; e.g. a calm person may manifestate water-related powers, and never fire-related powers. This reduces the combat versatility of the user, and to compensate this, most manipulators undergo rigorous training to either adapt their power to most situations, or to purely overwhelm their opponent (a much less popular option).

### Void traces

All the issues above can be circumvented by imbuing objects with the manipulator's energy. This allowed for others to analyze the object and more easily learn from other manipulators. This analysis is made by sensing the Void traces on the object (remnants of the object creator's energy), and from these adapt the gained knowledge to one's own understanding of the power imbued on the object.

A popular usage of traces is book imbuing, where a manipulator would imbue his, or hers, knowledge in the words written, so that another can read them and at the same time analyze the related traces for easier and deeper understanding of the power. This practice was so popular it became widespread among manipulators (the ones that had a high enough degree of intelligence to understand the traces), and a new name was given to those that took advantage of this: Book Hunters.

Do note, however, that this practice is not at all a game changer for combat capabilities of manipulators. Although it allows for faster learning of different form of manipulation, it does not deepen that knowledge to the point of an *inherent*, or natural, form of manipulation. Yes, it does provide a wider array of powers and, at first, a Book Hunter is extremely overpowered as opposed to a traditional manipulator but, as time goes on, the manipulator will take his power to much higher levels than those of a Book Hunter, to the point of being an overwhelming force.

This can be circumvented by creating/reading books depicting a higher form of manipulation but, the further away from a hunter's natural skill it is, the harder it is to learn, a fact aggrevated by the difficulty of the skill in the book. For example, a hunter that naturally manipulates fire will have a harder time learning a water skill than a fire skill.

The lower-level skills, due to their basic nature, are quite easily understood by most rookie hunters.

Contrary to popular belief, knowing higher forms of skills does not directly easen the learning process of other higher forms; the intelligence gained/needed from it, however, does.

[^2]: Refers to the concentration of Void energy in the environment (not bound to an individual). See [Void Particles](../void-particles/).
[^3]: Commonly used skill; it conceals the user in a cloak of void that gives the illusion of invisibility.
