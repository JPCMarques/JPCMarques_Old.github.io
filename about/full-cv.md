# Basic Information #

* Name: João Marques
* Age: 22
* Current Occupation: Computer Science Student

# Description #

---

I am mostly interested in Object Oriented Programming languages, as they are more adaptive, even if less efficient 
(*coughs* Java *coughs*) and how to use it in modern life, and how to easen our daily routines with applications to automate,
or hasten, monotonous, boring tasks.

I am enthusiastic about games, and how we, the small developer community that plays a specific game, can aid its growth in
some way. One of my apps, IFBCompanion, is one such example, of how a **very** simple app can make the gaming experience
more pleasant in some way (even though is targeted at a niche).

I also dabble a little in writing light novels (as poorly as that might be) and am an avid reader, be it standard novels,
light novels, manga, anything that can pique my interest.
