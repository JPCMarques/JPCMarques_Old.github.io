Like said in the post, the story has begun to drag. The story didn't move much from last time: all that changed was that the MC did some
training we don't see, and is only referenced by the lesser gods wanting to capitalize on Cross' rise to power to gain political themselves.

We don't see much in the ways of character development, only part that develops the main character is `"And makes sense. Let's do this again - I think I bled some energy off that one."`, where we are teased that he may be starting to learn some magic that not many magicians know (Absorption). Nate doesn't
develop much from how he was introduced to us, and we don't learn anything about him besides what was previously established.

Consitency is what I had the most issues with. At first, while in courtship, the MC is basicly "immune" to aggression from the courtees and their family. Then, on the party, he learns that women take a more active role and can themselves decide to break off the courtship, instead of being passed as merchandise like it seemed they would be on the first chapters (this being addressed by the women themselves in the party). Then all of a sudden, should the courtee be offended, they can just duel and kill you? What?

The flow, however, was in my opinion flawless - organic and seemed like an actual lesson, with the little story development it had being interweaved with the dialogue seamlessly.
