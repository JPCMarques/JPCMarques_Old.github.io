Development must handle changing needs fast enough to meet demands -> Reduce magnitude of development cycle (smaller phases = higher adaptability, e.g. SCRUM)

Adapting software is usually better and faster to reach a minimum deliverable product, as opposed to building from scratch.

Adaptability to change is also important for internal processes, to shorten their duration and increase their efficiency.

There's an higher and higher need to adapt for any situation, typically with things out of the enterprise's control, to integrate with a larger number of entities
seamlessly and effortlessly (integration with and in **supply chains**)
