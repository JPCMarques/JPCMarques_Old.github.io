# Hi #

I am a Computer Science student interested in all things that involve programming. I am 22 years old and this site was
designed with the intent of being both a virtual resume, and a hosting place for all my projects.

I am mostly interested in Object Oriented Programming languages, as they are more adaptive, even if less efficient 
(*coughs* Java *coughs*) and how to use it in modern life, and how to easen our daily routines with applications to automate,
or hasten, monotonous, boring tasks.

I am enthusiastic about games, and how we, the small developer community that plays a specific game, can aid its growth in
some way. One of my apps, IFBCompanion, is one such example, of how a **very** simple app can make the gaming experience
more pleasant in some way (even though is targeted at a niche).

I also dabble a little in writing light novels (as poorly as that might be) and am an avid reader, be it standard novels,
light novels, manga, anything that can pique my interest.

Hope you enjoy my website and projects!
