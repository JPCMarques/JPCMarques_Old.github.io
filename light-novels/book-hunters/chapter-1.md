  A man opened a door, illuminating wide room until then pitch black, revealing shelves upon shelves of books, books and some
  loose pages lying on the floor, covered in dust, most eaten by long-dead larvae as sustenance. The light coming from the opening
  allowed the man to see just how big the place he found was, as it seemed it would go on forever in the void of darkness.
  
  "Jackpot!" - he shouted. Two more men came into the room from behind him, armed with guns that gave off a faint light 
  from the barrel - "Look at the size of this place! Seems like we'll be having a great haul today! Stand guard while I
  try to find the valuable ones." 
  
  "Man, why are we always the ones stuck with the boring tasks? We want to go hunting too!"
  
  "Speak for yourself Dean, I like to just chill with my gun and get paid. Easiest job I ever had"
  
  "The most boring too."
  
  "Yeah well, at least you're still human. That tin can over there has hardly anything human remaining in him."
  
  "I really wish you would stop bitching about having the easy job."
  
  "It's easy but you get the free augs."
  
  "Well, I also get the pain and the freaks. Hardly anyone wants to have sex with a man that's half robot."
  
  "That's because you don't have the right augs."
  
  "Unlike you, I was born without needing them there."
  
  "Oh, go fuck yourself, tin can. Just do your thing with the books and we'll stay here, bored half to death."
  
  "Don't let him do anything stupid, LL."
  
  "Don't worry Raynell, I have been babysitting him for 5 years now."
  
  "Dick." - replied Dean, turning his back to the two and walking towards the entrance.
  
  "This could take awhile, it seems to be at least 100 meters in length."
  
  "Chill, the longer you take the more likely it is for us get an actual good haul. The last ones were shit."
  
  "Yeah I know. We could barely fuel the reactor for this trip." - Raynell turned his back on LL and proceeded into the dark, while LL joined Dean.
