  A man opened a door, illuminating a wide room, until then pitch black, revealing shelves upon shelves of books, books and some
  loose pages lying on the floor, covered in dust, most eaten by long-dead larvae as sustenance. The light coming from the opening
  allowed the man to see just how big the place he found was, as it seemed it would go on forever in the void of darkness.
  
  "Jackpot!" - he shouted. Two more men came into the room from behind him, armed with guns that gave off a faint light 
  from the barrel - "Look at the size of this place! Seems like we'll be having a great haul today! Stand guard while I
  try to find the valuable ones." 
  
  "Man, why are we always the ones stuck with the boring tasks? We want to go hunting too!"
  
  "Speak for yourself Dean, I like to just chill with my gun and get paid. Easiest job I ever had"
  
  "The most boring too."
  
  "Yeah well, at least you're still human. That tin can over there has hardly anything human remaining in him."
  
  "I really wish you would stop bitching about having the easy job."
  
  "It's easy but you get the free augs."
  
  "Well, I also get the pain and the freaks. Hardly anyone remotely normal wants to have sex with a man that's half robot."
  
  "That's because you don't have the right augs."
  
  "Unlike you, I was born without needing them there."
  
  "Oh, go fuck yourself, tin can. Just do your thing with the books and we'll stay here, bored half to death."
  
  "Don't let him do anything stupid, LL."
  
  "Don't worry Raynell, I have been babysitting him for 5 years now."
  
  "Dick." - replied Dean, turning his back to the two and walking towards the entrance.
  
  "This could take awhile, it seems to be at least 100 meters in length."
  
  "Chill, the longer you take the more likely it is for us get an actual good haul. The last ones were shit."
  
  "Yeah I know. We could barely fuel the reactor for this trip." - Raynell turned his back on LL and proceeded into the dark, while LL joined Dean.
  
  Raynell went through the corridors, looking for anything that stood out from the rest, before starting to process all
  the books, turning on his night vision augment. He let his hand slide through along the covers of the books in the 
  shelves, feel its rough and old edges against his artificial hardened skin.
  
  *Is this how it really feels?* - he couldn't help but wonder. - *Is Dean right? Am I even still human?*
   
   He continued into the library, absorbed in his existential crisis, wandering aimlessly. When he came to, he was lost.
   
   "Dean, LL!" - Raynell shouted, with only echo in response. He tried running in what he thought was the direction he came from, to no avail.
   Always coming back to what seemed to be the same bookshelves, the same pattern of loose sheets of papers and footprints in the dusty floor,
   began to feel panic, immediately steeled himself.
   
   *Calm down. No point in wasting energy*
   
   Raynell carefully studied the room around him, but nothing seemed to be out of place. Always the same pattern of footprints
   on the floor, the same pages on the floor and the same books on the shelves. 
   
   *Hmm... If I'm not leaving any new footprints, I wonder if I can have any effect on this place, at all?* 
   
   He tried to pull a book off the shelf. Instead of the book moving, it was like his hand was pulling an immovable object.
   
   Next, he tried to punch the same book.
   
   *Strange. I expected it not to move when I hit it, but I didn't get hurt trying to punch it, either! What the fuck is going on?!*
   
   At that point, he truly began to feel scared. He was trapped, like a bird in a cage, with cold sweat dripping from near
   the corner of his eyes. Panicking, he threw more and more punches, all with no effect.
   
   After pointlessly exhausting himself, he sat on the floor, with his arms over his knees and his sweat falling on the floor,
   without mixing with the dust, instead just laying there in tiny pools, without even touching the dust on the floor.
   
   *I'm not in the library anymore! This is a place entirely different, where I can't affect reality!*
   
   He ran into the walls. They didn't budge, but he didn't feel pain either. Instead, he just bounced back.
   
   *On the bright side, this means there is definitely something of value here. Otherwise there wouldn't be such an intricate trap here.*
   *On the other hand, I'm probably going to die here.*
   
   <center>&diams;</center>
   
   Time passed, for what felt like days. Most of his status augments (time, location, life form scanners...) weren't working at all.
   He felt tired from several tries of breaking the trap. Even worse, he was thirsty and hungry, with hardly any emergency supplies.
   
   Laying down on the floor he thought:
   
   *This is probably the slowest, most boring, way to go. I should probably rest and hope someone comes to save me.*
   
   He closed his eyes, and felt his consciousness slowly fade away.
   
   *Who are you, and why are you invading my domain?* - an ominous voice echoed in his mind.
   
   *What the fuck?!*
   
   *Well, what the fuck, what are you doing here?*
   
   *My name is not... never mind. You were the one that trapped me in here. It's not like I tried to get here.*
   
   *That's impossible. My trap is set to activate when someone attempts to invade the sanctum.*
   
   *Invade? I was just walking among the dusty shelves when I got trapped in here.*
   
   *The Library IS the sanctum!*
   
   *To who? It wasn't disturbed in millennia...*
   
   *The Book Hunters, of course!* - the voice almost yelled, proudly.
   
   *Who the hell are those?!*
   
   *They are the greatest order of magicians in the planet, and the most ancient one too.*
   
   *Your magicians must suck, hard.*
   
   *YOU DARE INSULT US?!*
   
   *Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to insult you. I'm merely observing that your planet was dead for millennia, so they
   can't be really that great.*

   Silence fell in his mind for a while.
   
   *So that's why it wasn't activated in so, so long. Well, time for me to sleep, and for you to die.*
   
   Raynell felt excruciating pain emanating through his spine. In his mind, he yelled:
   
   *STOP! What if I become a Book Hunter?*
   
   The pain stopped.
   
   *Hmmm. Well, I guess if you pass the entry test I can't kill you.*
   
   *What do I have to do?*
   
   *Open your eyes. I'll meet you in the trap.*
   
   He opened his eyes and stood up.
   
   In front of him was a cloud of energy in the form of a human being. In its hand, was a small book.
   
   "This is your test. Read this book and we will know if you are a Book Hunter."
