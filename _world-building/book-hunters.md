## The manuscripts ## 

---

Manuscripts are the main source of power for the Book Hunters, beings which tap into the life contained within words to 
gain power of their own.

As such, they operate under strict rules, which can never be broken:

  * The hunter can only gain one ability, if any, from a manuscript.
  * The manuscript can not grant the same ability twice.
  * The ability granted by the manuscript will match the hunter's persona.
  * There is no limit of attempts a hunter can have to obtain an ability; since they match their persona, if their
  persona changes, then the ability that wasn't granted can now be under his or hers ability set.
  * The manuscript does not have to be read in the traditional way; hunters can see, hear, feel and witness the manuscript's
  content by simple touch.
  * For an ability to be granted, the hunter must be holding the manuscript.

Even hunters are not free of (some) rules:

  * To be able to tap into a manuscript, the hallmark of a hunter, one requires years of training, or a natural talent.
  * The hunter must relate to the ability user in the manuscript in some way to be able to obtain it's ability.
  * No hunter can write a "tapable" manuscript, only a regular human being.
  * The writer must not be under any form of duress to write a manuscript that can be tapped. As such, young and inexperienced 
  Book Hunters are generally forbidden to be in contact with authors.
