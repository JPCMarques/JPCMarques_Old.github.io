My thoughts and impressions on stuff I read about will be posted here.

Sources for my reading material are usually either physical copies of the books, epubs (legal ones) or [/r/WritingPrompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/).

I will try to organize the reviews neatly so that they're easy to find. Without further ado, here they are:

- [Writing Prompts](writing-prompts/)
- [Short Stories](short-stories/)
- [Books](books/)
