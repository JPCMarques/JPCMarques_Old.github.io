Alarms sounded all over the Sanctum, startling Guardian who was idling by a tall bookshelf, high up in the tower. Immediately, a monitor appeared in front of him, displaying Raynell and a revolving vortex of Void Energy around him, eating away at his surroundings.

*For fuck's sake* - Guardian thought, as he flew to Raynell's room as fast as he could, seeming almost like teleporting to the less trained eye. The monitor showed the vortex gradually increasing in intensity.

When he reached the room, the vortex had already eaten away most of the walls. In the center, was Raynell, crying with his hands on the back of his head, and elbows on top of his knees.

Without uttering a word, Guardian pointed the palm of his hand at Raynell's head. He formed a small ball of iron, shooting it almost immediately at Raynell's head. As it hit him, he instantly fell to his side, and the vortex subsided, some blood coming off the impact point.

*What the fuck? The bullet curved?! It was meant to kill him...* - after a moment of astonishment, Guardian manifested a metal, flaming sword, pushing it downwards at Raynell's body. 

Just as it was about to hit him, a dark tendril gripped the blade, completely shattering it. Guardian dropped it, as it quickly turned to dust on the floor.

Tendrils eerily lifted the unconscious body that hosted them, until it was in an upright position, forcing its right arm to raise, pointed at Guardian. After a moment of dark silence, the eldritch formations burst forth towards Guardian, like a tidal wave of dark, slimy horrific abominations. Guardian didn't move, enveloped by a blue shield of energy.

*A Void Chosen! I never expected to see one in my lifetime! He should prove to be quite useful…* Guardian joined his hands in front of him, slightly hunching over them. Gradually, he began separating them, the space between them a condensed ball of lightning and fire. From his left hand, he fed the ball flames and forcefully compressed it; from the other, he fed electricity to be contained within the sphere, and compressed oxygen to feed the blaze. 

The sphere kept growing, until it became unstable, irregularly increasing and decreasing in volume as Guardian struggled to compress it. *As blessed by the Void you are, you still don’t hold a candle to me.* He stopped controlling the sphere, allowing it to explode, destroying the Void appendages that surrounded him, forcing them to recede into Raynell, protecting him from the blast. 

Around them, was an empty sphere, the space consumed by the explosion. Raynell’s body fell near the center of the crater, charred and twitching from the electricity that forcibly entered his body, while Guardian slowly fell, like a feather.

“Look what you made me do… When you wake up, I’m going to make you rebuild all this.” *Thankfully, he’ll regenerate fast, as a Void Chosen… Oh dear Caroline, how I miss you…* Guardian turned away from Raynell and floated away.

Through endless halls, he floated, until he reached one with no illumination, where he stopped. “Open up, my love.” The space in front of him spread, giving way to a brightly lit room, where a woman hovered, dark tendrils coming off her back and into the ceiling. Her hair had grown to the point where it was spread out on the white floor, her whole naked body completely white. 

Guardian floated up to her, placing his right hand on her cheek, gazing into her lifeless eyes.  “Oh, how I miss you, my love! I want to cry, but even that they took away from me… Instead, I am left here, watching my braindead beloved with only pain and longing in my heart… The gift they gave me…” He joined their foreheads. “Not too long now, my sweet Caroline… I may have found your ticket out of here…”

The city outside what was now the Sanctum, bustling with life, was filled with creatures of every kind, all of them Book Hunters. Some even needed to use minimizing manipulations, so that they would also be able to move inside of it. In the central plaza, there was a significant commotion. Hundreds of Manipulators were encircling a couple, a white-winged man and a dark-winged woman. Between the two, was a new-born girl, asleep.
“My friends!” – The man spoke – “Our child is finally born, and it is a Void Chosen!”
The crowd cheered in unison – “Long live the King! Long live the Queen! Long live the Void Kingdom!”
Amidst the cheering, five manipulators turned their back to the crowd and teleported away.

Sixteen years had passed. The King was overseeing the training of his daughter, in a balcony of an arena hundreds of meters wide. She was fighting twenty warriors, alone, using only physical enhancement manipulations. Neither side was at an advantage, which was a testament to the princess’ combat prowess.

Five manipulators teleported behind the King. “My King, may we have a moment?” The one in the middle, their leader, asked, as they made a simultaneous bow. The King turned around, raising his right hand in a dismissive motion, “At ease, brother. What is it that you need?”

“We completed the Sanctum project.” 

The King’s lips formed a smile. “That’s great! When can we visit it?”

“Whenever you want.”

“Let’s go then.” – he turned back to the arena, shouting – “Caroline!” – the group stopped fighting, and all turned to face their ruler – “Come with me, your uncle and I have something to show you!”  - she began to walk toward her father.

He turned back to face his brother. Turning his head to the sky and shouting once more – “My Queen, the Sanctum is complete, come to me so we can go together.”

Almost instantly, the dark-winged queen appeared beside her husband, falling from the sky at such speeds that she caused a sonic boom. Immediately after, Caroline emerged between the two.

“What we waiting for, then?” – asked Caroline, as sweat dripped down her face.

The group of eight finished the tour of the Sanctum. The King asked, “Can I see what you are using as an energy source to maintain it?”

“Of course.”  

<center>&diams;</center>

The group reached the end of a pitch black corridor. The brother opened up a door to a pure white room, with dark tendrils coming off the ceiling and floor in the middle, as if attempting to touch each other, with a small empty space preventing the formation of a column of tendrils.

“There’s nothing here…” – Suddenly, the King felt a sword of Void Energy at his throat. Turning around, both his wife and child were in the same situation – “What is the meaning of this, brother?!”

“You see, we could never find a sustainable energy source for the Sanctum. That is until we realized that your daughter, Caroline, as a Void Chosen, would be the perfect energy source. She has nearly endless Void reserves, the Void won’t kill her, and we wouldn’t have to worry about renewing the energy source every time it runs out since she won’t run out. This room will preserve her body so that she doesn’t die of old age, sickness or any other natural form of death.”

“Dad?” – Caroline asked, voice trembling with terror as tears began to stream down her face.

“Stop this at once! We can find another energy source!”

“And when will that be? When the monsters invade us and wipe us out completely? When the sacrifice isn’t just your daughter, but everyone’s?” – he signaled his men to bring Caroline towards the tendrils.

“STOP THIS, NOW!” – waves of Void Energy emanated from the King, vaporizing the sword at his throat and causing his brother to stagger back.

“No, brother, you should stop. Look at your wife. She’s not as strong as you, is she?” – he nodded to his follower, which made a shallow cut in her throat, forcing her to let out a muffled groan of pain.
She smiled at him, and said, “Save our daughter” as she plunged the blade into her throat.

The King turned to the three men moving his daughter to the tendrils, which started to run faster and prepared to attack them. However, he was struck by his brother, who grabbed him and prevented him moving.

“You can’t stop me!”

“I only need to stall you.”

At that moment, the three men had thrown his daughter into the tendrils. She wailed in pain, as they begun to dig into her body. 

“NO!” – the King cried, as he fell to his knees, seemingly losing all his strength.

He stood there, watching his daughter wail until she could wail no more, and his brother struck him in the back of his head, leaving him unconscious.
