Guardian lead Raynell out of the room. Around them, was a brightly lit hall, pure white without any decorations. Along the ceiling ran thin, bright white lines, at most 4cm thick, so bright they stood out even in the white background of the ceiling. The Guardian looked up to the veiny ceiling, and said, calmly:

"To the lobby, please." - at that momemt, the light began to pulse with spots of light, much brighter than the rest of the "vein", starting to move towards the direction the guardian was looking to.

"One thing you should immediately know, is that all the movement areas, or tools, have safety protocols put in place, so that only Book Hunters or their creations can use them. What I just did is a necessity, since if I don't do it, the hall would trap me inside of it. Kind of like what I did to you."

"Why, though?"

"Numerous times, humans attempted to invade the Sanctum to claim it for themselves and use the knowledge within, even though that knowledge is useless to them, or simply eliminate us. Every time, we slaughtered them, in a matter of seconds, since they were invading a space controled by us, and we can simply fold that space into itself and crush them inside. But, this was tedious and bloody work, so we devised a funnier and more elegant approach. We basicly locked the armies in an infinitely looping space, watching them starve to death and place bets on how many would resourt to cannibalism, or who would be the last to die."

"That's terrible! Why would you do that?"

"Before it came to this, the Sanctum was a place for both Book Hunters and humans to share knowledge and together, strive towards a better community. We gave power to the humans, and asked for nothing in return. At first, it was an harmonious relationship, they grew faster thanks to us, and we saw them as 'our babies' and enjoyed seeing them grow. But, they grew greedy. Soon, they wanted to become like us. At that point, Humanity was still in their early days, not mature enough to pass the trial. Still, they tried. And failed. Repeatedly."

Guardian paused for a bit.

"After that, they grew restless, kidnapping and experimenting on our weakest members in order to understand our power. They learned nothing of it, obviously, as they couldn't simply comprehend void. Naturally, we were enraged. At first, we simply destroyed the gateway to the Sanctum in Earth, called Atlantis, pulverized the whole island into dust, making sure the residents would suffer in their deaths, the same way they made ours suffer. We ripped off skin and fingers, broke bones and shattered minds, all in revenge for our fallen brothers. We sadly could never recover their bodies. But then, they grew smarter. They left their planet and found their way into other gateways, be it through luck or purpose. So we devised a way to prevent their entry, and entertain ourselve: the trap you were in."

"That's awful! But why am I alive then? And why are there no Book Hunters here?"

"We were betrayed by a human hunter, who taught human leaders how to use void tools, gave them technology that advanced their civilization by centuries, and led them in a war against us, ultimately slaughtering us all by betraying the humans in the battlefield, using the tools they trusted so much to leech all their innate void energy to feed his power. Millions of humans died in that battle, hundreds of us, and only that man was left standing, alone, after butchering both man and hunter."

A moment of silence fell upon the two, after which, Guardian continued.

"You live for one simple reason: by observing you, I "
