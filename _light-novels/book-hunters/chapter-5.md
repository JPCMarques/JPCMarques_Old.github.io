Guardian lead Raynell out of the room. Around them, was a brightly lit hall, pure white without any decorations. Along the ceiling ran thin, bright white lines, at most 4cm thick, so bright they stood out even in the white background of the ceiling. The Guardian looked up to the veiny ceiling, and said, calmly:

"To the lobby, please." - at that momemt, the light began to pulse with spots of light, much brighter than the rest of the "vein", starting to move towards the direction the guardian was looking to.

"One thing you should immediately know, is that all the movement areas, or tools, have safety protocols put in place, so that only Book Hunters or their creations can use them. What I just did is a necessity, since if I don't do it, the hall would trap me inside of it. Kind of like what I did to you."

"Why, though?"

"Numerous times, humans attempted to invade the Sanctum to claim it for themselves and use the knowledge within, even though that knowledge is useless to them, or simply eliminate us. Every time, we slaughtered them, in a matter of seconds, since they were invading a space controled by us, and we can simply fold that space into itself and crush them inside. But, this was tedious and bloody work, so we devised a funnier and more elegant approach. We basicly locked the armies in an infinitely looping space, watching them starve to death and place bets on how many would resourt to cannibalism, or who would be the last to die."

"That's terrible! Why would you do that?"

"Before it came to this, the Sanctum was a place for both Book Hunters and humans to share knowledge and together, strive towards a better community. We gave power to the humans, and asked for nothing in return. At first, it was an harmonious relationship, they grew faster thanks to us, and we saw them as 'our babies' and enjoyed seeing them grow. But, they grew greedy. Soon, they wanted to become like us. At that point, Humanity was still in their early days, not mature enough to pass the trial. Still, they tried. And failed. Repeatedly."

Guardian paused for a bit.

"After that, they grew restless, kidnapping and experimenting on our weakest members in order to understand our power. They learned nothing of it, obviously, as they couldn't simply comprehend void. Naturally, we were enraged. At first, we simply destroyed the gateway to the Sanctum in Earth, called Atlantis, pulverized the whole island into dust, making sure the residents would suffer in their deaths, the same way they made ours suffer. We ripped off skin and fingers, broke bones and shattered minds, all in revenge for our fallen brothers. We sadly could never recover their bodies. But then, they grew smarter. They left their planet and found their way into other gateways, be it through luck or purpose. So we devised a way to prevent their entry, and entertain ourselve: the trap you were in."

"That's awful! But why am I alive then? And why are there no Book Hunters here?"

"We were betrayed by a human hunter, who taught human leaders how to use void tools, gave them technology that advanced their civilization by centuries, and led them in a war against us, ultimately slaughtering us all by betraying the humans in the battlefield, using the tools they trusted so much to leech all their innate void energy to feed his power. Millions of humans died in that battle, hundreds of us, and only that man was left standing, alone, after butchering both man and hunter."

A moment of silence fell upon the two, after which, Guardian continued.

"You live for one simple reason: by observing you, I saw calm rationality. It's a trait that most humans don't possess, specially those in power, ironically. You see. when your leaders are elected by popularity, it's expected that the masses, as they are mostly backwards thinking morons, would elect a dumb fuck like them. You are the opposite. Even in the face of the unknown and the possibility of death, you calmly deduced what the trap consisted of. In a way, I guess you could say your test started when you got captured."

Raynell chuckled a little, and nodded in agreement.

"I can't even remember the last time we had a decent leader. I doubt history books remember, either."

Both of them laughed. As they finished, the end of the tunnel approached them, and they entered what seemed to be the main area of the sanctum.

A strong howl was heard throughout the ruins surrounding the entrance to the Sanctum, sending shivers down LL and Dean's spine.

"What was that?" - asked LL, scared.

"I'm going to say a local resident who noticed our presence."

"No shit, but *what* is it? The info they gave us about this place didn't mention creatures capable of such a howl."

"You know, it wouldn't be the first time they gave us incomplete intel."

"True, but that was scary as fuck."

"Man, we got these guns that could pulverize most living beings, and body armour that renders most attacks useless."

"I guess that's true."

In front of them, was a wide area, most likely an old plaza. Some remnants of richly-decorated floor tiles remained, indicating the area's forgotten wealth. The moon was high in the sky, filling the plaza with an eerie white light, forming gargantuan shadows from the twin spires on the opposite side of the square to where they both were standing. The buildings between the spires, half ruined, served as hiding place for a wide array of creatures that reclaimed the dead city as their own.

"We were given enough equipment to handle any creature that inhabits the area, so there won't be a problem, just relax - if there is something there that we weren't prepared for, at least we have these guns and armour."

From the ruined building, tens of wolves eyed the two of them, studying them and assessing whether they were a meal or something to avoid. Some of them began stealthily walking to the other ruins surrounding the square.

The difference in light was so great that Raynell was temporarily blinded by it. Instinctively, he covered his eyes.

"Hey, I've been meaning to ask, how can I see light, and now be almost blinded by it?"

"Almost everything in the Sanctum is made up of or by Void Energy, so your eyes will work mostly like they normally would. When you go outside, however, that changes."

"Alright."

As he regained his sight, he began to notice the intimidating size of the area they entered. It was a circular tower, with at least half a kilometer in diameter, and seemed to stretch upwards indefinitely, with a mostly hollow center, save for some round platforms floating in the air every couple of floors. Every floor had bookshelves full of books with various appearances: some looked like used notebooks, others had sheets of gold... some even had covers of some sort of skin. Each floor only had small, ringlike platform of five or so meters coming out of the bases of the bookshelves. The platforms, floating and otherwise, were all made of a metallic looking substance, similar in color to mercury.

The walls, what little could be seen of them between all the bookshelves, were built entirely in
