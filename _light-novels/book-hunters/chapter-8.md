Raynell was lead into his room, on the ground floor of the tower. It was small, only possessing the bare minimum of amenities: a couple's bed, bathroom, and a secretary, no chair.

"This will be your room in the Sanctum. Even if you change floors, the room will be the same, except for the fact that each ascended level increases its space and features, which you will learn about some other time. For now, just focus on resting."

"I get why this is small, but why the couple's bed though?"

"I thought humans liked having sex?"

"Uh... We do, but I don't see any females around..."

"You can just ask the Sanctum to create an artificial one should your needs become... unbearable. They won't be a paragon of intelligence or compassion, but for the job you want them to perform they will do just fine."

"Wow. Ok, let's pretend that didn't happen."

"Sure, you prude... Anyways, you can ask the Sanctum for literally anything, we can alchemize most things you think of, so you'll never run out of anything since the Void surrounds us."

"How do I ask the Sanctum for something? Just say, hey Sanctum, I want something?"

"Pretty much. You can also tell the Sanctum you are going to call it by another name if you ever grow tired of calling it that."

"Alright, thank you."

Guardian made a slight bow.

"I'll take my leave then. If you need anything, call me."

Raynell let himself fall on the bed on his back, with his arms wide open. Looking at the empty white ceiling, perfectly clean, he couldn't help but play out the unintentional murder of his two friends, over and over and over again.

*I need to do something to drown out these thoughts. Why have you guys been so silent?* - None of his other selves answered him. - *Oh come, on. There are infinite versions of me, and none of you has ever murdered anyone? Guys?*

Raynell started breathing heavily and hastily, becoming more and dizzier as he inhaled more significant amounts of oxygen every breath he took.

He sat down. *Calm down, worst case scenario, you do not have schizophrenia anymore.* 

Gripping his knees with his hands, using so much strength he started carving holes into his legs with his fingers; the pain helped mitigate the panic attack. Looking down, steeling himself, he, at last, yelled for help from Guardian.

A few seconds later, the energy being entered the room, worried about his sudden cry for help. "I can't hear the voices anymore... What happened to me?" He asked as tears were streaming down his face without him noticing it.

"You need to give me more than that to go on; guessing isn't exactly a good diagnostics tool."

Still, with a hint of panic inside him, Raynell quickly explained the lack of response from his doppelgangers.

"I don't know what to tell you, since your condition is unique, at least from my experience. I could, however, teach you how to enter your mind, or what you see as your mind."

"How would that even remotely help me?"

"If the voices you hear and speak through you are within your mind, then it is only logical that you can find them there, no?"

"I guess. So how long will this take me?"

"Weeks, perhaps even months."

"Uh, what?"

"Going inside your mind requires an incredible amount of control of your void energy and, at the moment, you can only move properly due to the movement aide I gave you. If you do it wrong, you can permanently damage your mind and body, and I'm assuming you don't want that. Besides, I thought it would be a blessing, getting rid of those distracting voices?"

Raynell didn't answer - he knew that to be true; the reason he did not want to lose the voices in his head was merely loneliness, as his two best friends laid crushed on the dead city floor.

Guardian noticed the inward reaction, and promptly changed the subject. "For now, rest. In the morning, we will begin training." As he said that, he turned his back to Raynell and headed to the door. Once it was on the outside and the door almost closed, Guardian reopened the door just a little so its head could be seen poking out. "If you want to get a head start, I suggest you meditate and try to feel your power." 

With Raynell still looking down unto the sheets, Guardian closed the door and left.

 As Dibalt left the Council House, he looked around at the city he swore to protect. *That cunt still likes giving me orders. I'll show him when he gets home, although he's right.* 

He began walking home through the winding streets of Rocktown, aptly name; the entire town was inside a cave, with every house built from the rocks mined in the expansion of the cave to house a growing a population.

It stretched for several miles of uniform buildings, with a few notable exceptions noticeable: the Council House, the hydroponic farms, the arena, and the breeding grounds.

The goal of the population of Rocktown was to retake the surface. As such, they were patiently growing their population until they had enough people to maintain a surface town, and protect it from the void beasts that would inevitably attack it. 

They had few manipulators, as the only way to awaken their abilities was through combat, on the brink of death. Even so, that kind of awakening was explosive, usually killing or permanently maiming the people surrounding them. As such, the arena was filled with combat robots, designed to leave humans on the brink of death, if they didn't get destroyed first.

Most of the population had fighting prowess and was in the army; the rest were scientists conducting their research (mostly on the void) inside the council house.

The only people allowed to go to the surface were manipulators, as they were the only ones capable of defending themselves, with the notable exception of the envoy Dibalt was tasked with protecting. 

Being a manipulator was a huge status symbol, and it was discovered (albeit *very* empirically) that that feature was hereditary, leading to the creation of the breeding grounds, where both men and women went to be impregnated or impregnate manipulators. Of course, some had other intentions, but that was to be expected from a sex den.

Most manipulators chose to give the children to non-manipulator surrogates (especially those that frequented the breeding grounds), very few manipulator couples decided to raise the child, as their army duties kept them too occupied to spend time with their children. That privilege was saved for the high-ranking officers, that did not go into the field that often and could somewhat raise them, even if they were unwilling spectators of their parent's job. 

Due to the conditions forced unto the remnant of humanity that resided in the massive cave system, society was brutally efficient and meritocratic: only those fittest to the task would be allowed to perform it. 

These principles of maximizing the efficiency of the society as a whole, rather than one's selfish needs and desires, lead to an unbroken chain of command and minimized nepotism, being taught to children since their first day of school.

*Maybe I should pay a visit to the breeding grounds. It's been a while, after all.*

Raynell was in a constant cycle of fading into sleep and violently waking up after seeing the nightmarish scene he painted with his power. After several hours of this, he gave up on the now alien notion to him that was sleep, despite every cell (how little they were now, that parts of his body were pure void energy) screaming with tiredness in pain.

*Maybe I should try meditating, see if it that does anything.* He sat on his bed, cross-legged with his hands, if they could be called that, resting on the crossed legs, closing his eyes as he attempted to sense the Void Energy coursing through his veins. And there it was. That eldritch ocean of power in his veins, laying perfectly still without any disturbance. 

*What if I try to do anything with it?* He opened his eyes, staring at the darkened room. *What should I do though?* As he stared forward at nothing, he quietly remembered Guardian saying that the Sanctum could create anything he wished. Then, perhaps, he too should be able to create anything from his power! Raynell closed his eyes again and attempted to focus on a simple object: a metal ball. Feeling his calm ocean slowly enraging on his veins, he tried to focus the raging waves into the metal ball. After a while, he felt his power calm down, opening his eyes. 

In front of him, laid a shiny iron ball, floating in the air. Not containing his excitement, he couldn't help but yell, "YES!". However, midst his exaltation, he remembered his crushed friends, taking his hands to his head as he began to cry. The ball started to bleed, further reminding him of the murder he committed. He felt his ocean rage yet again, more violently than before, and he was surrounded by pitch black darkness.
