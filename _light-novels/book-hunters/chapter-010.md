Raynell woke up in the crater of his making, unscathed. By his side was Guardian, waiting patiently for his awakening. 

"What happened? And why do I have such a massive headache?"

"Your powers went out of control, and I attempted to kill you by shooting you in the head, but you only got unconscious."

Raynell got up and backed away from Guardian.

"What?!"

"Please, do understand. You were absorbing your surroundings at an alarming pace, and my ultimate goal is to conserve this place. You have only been here a day; my attachment to you isn't that great."

"Still!"

"Calm the fuck down; I could have killed you while you were unconscious if I wanted to."

Raynell relaxed a little.

"Rather, I must confess I have been deceiving you to some extent. I told you a human hunter wiped out the human and hunter army. That isn't entirely true. I was the one that did that, as an act of revenge."

"Wait, what? You tried to kill me and committed genocide?!" - he backed away even further.

"As an act of revenge, yes."

"The hunters and humans that betrayed me. I made them all suffer as they did to my daughter."

"Explain yourself!"

"It would be easier if I showed you." - Guardian raised his right hand, pointing it at Raynell. Raynell instinctively raised both his arms to protect his head, creating a void barrier and destroying a part of the ceiling as he did so.

"No!"

"Man, seriously? If I wanted to kill you, you would be dead." - Guardian pointed his hand to the side of Raynell's head projecting a void laser that tore through the barrier and shone beside Raynell - "See?"

Raynell lowered his arms.

"See? Was it that hard? Now relax, this won't hurt. Physically at least."

"What do you" - he was cut out mid-sentence, as a similar laser hit his head, without damaging him.

Raynell experienced first-hand how the King's brother murdered his daughter, and how he felt with the instantaneous loss of all his loved ones. The suicide of his wife, the murder of his daughter and the betrayal of his oldest partner.

Tears streamed down Raynell's face. Not a single second had passed since he was hit with the memory beam. "This still doesn't explain how and why you committed genocide."

"After that, my brother incriminated me in front of the Council, responsible for judging any crime and, despite my numerous attempts to defend myself, the council still believed him. In hindsight, they probably knew about the whole thing. I was dragged in void chains in front of my whole kingdom, to be executed by my own brother. All my subjects cheered and threw rocks at me, even as my brother ripped off my wings with brute force, even as my screams of pain were louder than their cheers. Even as my head was ripped off my shoulders by my own brother."

"My last thoughts, or the King's to be precise, as he created me as a manifestation of his will when he was dying, were to avenge me... him and save Caroline. And so I did. I killed my whole kingdom, sparing no man, woman or children, be they manipulators or not."

Raynell wasn't sure what emotion to express. He knew he committed genocide, but also felt the same way he did after his family was taken away from him in a few seconds.

"So the city outside is what remains of your kingdom?"

"Yes."

"So why am I still alive then? Why did you tell me all this?"

"Because I need your help. You are a Void Chosen like my daughter, and I want you to break her free from this place. And, as a reward, I will give you the Sanctum, and all the knowledge it contains."

"Not that I'm complaining about being alive, but why didn't you just replace her with me? And why haven't you broke her free already, since you're much stronger than me?"

"Simply removing her from the tendrils is impossible. The Sanctum has a massive hold on her. Even if I did pull her out of it with brute force, she would be catatonic at best, stuck in the state she's currently in."

"Why do you need me then?"

"As a Void Chosen, you are in communion with the Void at a level most people can't even dream of. The kind of things you can do with it, and the level you can reach, is beyond comprehension. However, in your current state, you're more like a bottlecap holding back a nuke. You can't even do the most basic manipulation, without obliterating your surroundings."

Raynell lowered his head, looking at his hands. *He's right... I'm a danger to everyone surrounding me...*

"That's why I want to train you. So you can learn to control your powers and, ultimately, save my daughter and free me."

"Weren't you already going to train me?"

"Yes, but this is different. Rather than teaching you how to command the Void, which you already do innately, I will show you how to control your own mind, so that you are stable enough to control the massive amount of energy you have at your disposal."

"What about the voices in my head? Where have they gone to?"

"My working theory, seeing your current condition, is that they were the result of a shock-like reaction your mind did to all the void energy clashing with it. You, or rather, your unconscious self could not make sense of the finite infinity that is the Void. So, it made what it thought were infinite versions of you because, well, if a mind can control infinity, it's that great of a logic leap to assume it too, must be infinite.."

Guardian paused his explanation to give time for Raynell to absorb all the information he was given.

"As your comprehension grew, albeit from traumatic experiences, and you began to see what the new, or rather, replaced, parts of your body really were, you stopped seeing it as endless versions of yourself crammed down into a single being."

"I guess that makes sense... " - said Raynell, confused - "Well, its less clutter in my mind anyway. So how is the training going to begin?"

"Before we can begin any proper training, there is something you must do before." - Guardian gesticulated with his right hand, making two bodies, encased in a ball of energy, appear. 

Raynell crawled back a couple of meters until he hit the closest pure white wall, looking horrified at the mangled bodies of his friends, now clearly illuminated and the real terror of his actions revealed to him: most of their bones were visible, their faces barely recognizable.  In the bottom of the energy balls, was a pool of blood, with some teeth and other bones at the bottom. Raynell puked on the floor.

"You must bury the bodies of your friends and give yourself some closure so that those memories don't continue to haunt you." - Guardian turned around and began to leave, coming to a stop after he noticed Raynell didn't move. He turned around again to face him, offered his energy arm as an aid for Raynell to get up, saying "Come on, I'll show you how hunters 'bury' the bodies of their loved ones."
