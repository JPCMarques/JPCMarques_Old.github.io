Raynell kept yelling until he could do so no more. Gradually, his blood receded into his body, and the wounds on his hands closed up. But, he stood there, looking at the pure white moon, as he could not direct his look at the scene of his lack of control, that cost his friends' life and his mind.

He kept looking at the distant moon, watching its slow crawl through the sky, wishing he had never inherited that accursed power from the Void. When he saw the moon disappear into the horizon, he expected some sort of sunshine, but none came. Instead, from the opposite side, another moon appeared, defying everything he knew about moons and their relationship to their possessive planets. Still, despite his surprise, his body did not move, at all.

Once again, he gained the courage to look at his friends and, upon seeing their crushed bodies, he couldn't help but puke, tears running down his face and onto the puked floor. He forced himself up, feeling like he had a giant pushing down on his body. When he finally stood up completely, vertigo overcame him, stumbling until stabilized.

Dragging his feet one after the other, he came back the way he came from, leaving a trail of tears in his wake.

As he finished watching the scene from a monitor, Guardian moved his hand in a downward motion, from in front of the monitor, causing it to disappear.

He was in a white room, devoid of any decorations or other features, only the white walls, floor, and ceiling, as well as the bright white light they seemed to emit.

"Caroline, please go fetch those human bodies and preserve them. Leave the wolf where it is."

"Very well, sir."

A voice echoed through the room, its origin impossible to guess; it was as if the room itself was responding to Guardian.

<center>&diams;</center>

In a black, poorly lit room, five men were surrounding a large, circular table, that projected a blue holographic globe on top of it, with a massive red circle near one of the poles.

The men looked at each other, fearful of the red circle. The calmest of the five firmly said:

"Assemble the council. A high-level monster has awakened."

As he entered the bottom floor of the Sanctum's tower, looking up at the seemingly endless height of the tower, he couldn't help but fall to his knees, arms on his side, with tears streaming down his face.  From far up in the tower, Guardian was coming down towards him, with a speed of descent akin to that of a feather falling.

"What seems to be the problem, Raynell?"

"I killed a void wolf... And my best friends, their bodies crushed by my power... I couldn't control it, after all."

"Hey... Look on the bright side, at least you don't need my movement aid anymore..."

"Fuck off! Do you really think I care about that right now?"

"You certainly don't seem to care all that much about killing your friends."

"...What?" - void particles began to gather behind Raynell

"You've been smiling every step of the way until here." - particles began to gather faster.

"No fucking way... I just killed my friends, can barely stand up, and I've spent the whole way here crying... what reason would I even have to smile?"

"Beats me, but you are, and have been, smiling for a while."

By this point, there was a massive gathering of particles behind Raynell.

"Look, I'll show you... " - Guardian formed a mirror with his powers and turned it towards Raynell - "See?!"

The particles all fell on the floor, dissipating. In the mirror, there was Raynell. Grinning.

"General, what do you mean, a high-level monster appeared?"

"It was brief - but we had readings of an explosion of energy, unlike any we've seen before."

The man was dressed in a simple, blue uniform, without any ornamentation, besides the symbols woven on his right shoulder that seemed to represent his military rank.

About five meters ahead of him laid a semi-circular table, that surrounded him, with only a small opening behind, through which he passed earlier to stand in the middle of the Council of Elders. There were old men sitting on the other side of the table, on chairs that formed a gradient of exuberance and rich decoration: the ones closer to the gap were the least adorned, while the one straight ahead of the General was the most adorned, displaying the vast difference in rank among Council members.

Curiously, the highest council member had not yet spoken since the arrival of the General, despite the revelation that he had presented to the Council.

"We should assemble our troops and eliminate the threat before it is too late, we can not give it time to grow anymore, or we won't be able to defend ourselves when it inevitably comes for us!"

"What was its level?"~ a man two chairs to the right of the leader asked.

"We could not determine it accurately. We saw small bursts of energy in our sensors, but that is normal for the area - it's abundant with Void Beasts, which inevitably fight each other. However, what surprised us was a sudden burst of energy, that made all other bursts of energy stop in a radius of 10 km, that could only come out of a high-level monster."

Finally, the man in the middle spoke.

"If it is such a high-level beast, I'm afraid we would incur its wrath should we attempt to eliminate it, not to mention the fact that we probably can't even kill it even if we try. Such beasts normally have a high level of intelligence, shouldn't we at least attempt to reason with the thing? It has nothing to gain by attacking us."

"Sir, with all due respect, monsters of that level to behave in a... draconic way. They assume that, due to their power, all is theirs, and any being that even questions that fact should not be allowed to live."

"Why do you say that? Have you met any?"

"No. It is what all our ancestors told us, told you, as we grew up. We have no reason to doubt their teachings."

"Times change, Dibalt. We too must change with it."

"But Sir!"

"Dibalt, I think only of our self-preservation. Neither side has anything to gain with an all-out battle: we do not have any significant manipulator on our side or any void reserves that the monster might want to feed on. And we can't afford to lose most, if not all, of our forces fighting a monster of such level."

The council all seemed to nod at the same time, agreeing with their leader.

"Sir, if we send an envoy we might anger it further!"

"If we send an army and fail, then what? Who will protect our children?! Who will protect us from other beasts? If the envoy fails, then we lost a handful of people and fight the monster anyways. Now, I will select the party that you will personally escort to meet the monster, and you will do so without showing any hostility towards it, even if it *kills* any member of your party. Do I make myself clear?"

"Yes, sir." - he said, bowing slightly as he walked back through the opening in the table, then turning around and heading to the shadowed door in front of him, the only light in the room illuminating the table.
