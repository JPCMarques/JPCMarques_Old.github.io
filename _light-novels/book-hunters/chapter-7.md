Raynell kept yelling until he could do so no more. Gradually, his blood receded into his body, and the wounds on his hands closed up. But, he stood there, looking at the pure white moon, as he could not direct his look at the scene of his lack of control, that cost his friends' life and his mind.

He kept looking at the distant moon, watching its slow crawl through the sky, wishing he had never inherited that accursed power from the Void. When he saw the moon disappear into the horizon, he expected some sort of sunshine, but none came. Instead, from the opposite side, another moon appeared, defying everything he knew about moons and their relationship to their possessive planets. Still, despite his surprise, his body did not move, at all.

Once again, he gained the courage to look at his friends and, upon seeing their crushed bodies, he couldn't help but puke, tears running down his face and onto the puked floor. He forced himself up, feeling like he had a giant pushing down on his body. When he finally stood up completely, vertigo overcame him, stumbling until stabilized.

Dragging his feet one after the other, he came back the way he came from, leaving a trail of tears in his wake.

As he finished watching the scene from a monitor, Guardian moved his hand in a downward motion, from in front of the monitor, causing it to disappear.

He was in a white room, devoid of any decorations or other features, only the white walls, floor, and ceiling, as well as the bright white light they seemed to emit.

"Caroline, please go fetch those human bodies and preserve them. Leave the wolf where it is."

"Very well, sir."

A voice echoed through the room, its origin impossible to guess; it was as if the room itself was responding to Guardian.

In a black, poorly lit room, five men were surrounding a large, circular table, that projected a blue holographic globe on top of it, with a massive red circle near one of the poles.

The men looked at each other, fearful of the red circle. The calmest of the five firmly said:

"Assemble the council. A high-level monster has awakened."

As he entered the bottom floor of the Sanctum's tower, looking up at the seemingly endless height of the tower, he couldn't help but fall to his knees, arms on his side, with tears streaming down his face.  From far up in the tower, Guardian was coming down towards him, with a speed of descent akin to that of a feather falling.

"What seems to be the problem, Raynell?"

"I killed a void wolf... And my best friends, their bodies crushed by my power... I couldn't control it, after all."

"Hey... Look on the bright side, at least you don't need my movement aid anymore..."

"Fuck off! Do you really think I care about that right now?"

"You certainly don't seem to care all that much about killing your friends."

"...What?" - void particles began to gather behind Raynell

"You've been smiling every step of the way until here." - particles began to gather faster.

"No fucking way... I just killed my friends, can barely stand up, and I've spent the whole way here crying... what reason would I even have to smile?"

"Beats me, but you are, and have been, smiling for a while."

By this point, there was a massive gathering of particles behind Raynell.

"Look, I'll show you... " - Guardian formed a mirror with his powers and turned it towards Raynell - "See?!"

The particles all fell on the floor, dissipating. In the mirror, there was Raynell. Grinning.
