Dibalt was getting dressed, after spending the rest of the afternoon in one of the breeding grounds. He had had several women throughout the evening, some low to mid-ranking manipulators (high ranking, and consequently highly skilled, were not a very common sight in the breeding grounds, be they male or female). 

He used his power to generate enough heat to evaporate his sweat (without damaging his skin) - this was an ordinary skill in the caverns, as it allowed for a lower water consumption - and exited the room towards the entrance of the building.

The halls were long and full of the most varied moans, some pleasureful, other happily painful. The walls were dyed with a velvety red, illuminated in a dark light of the same tone. The same pattern was replicated in each of the rooms, with some of sheets and pillows being in a blacker tone. 

The several breeding grounds were run and maintained by a team of manipulators, that rapidly cleaned the rooms from all excess fluids, to minimize the downtime of each room. Using void energy, the fabrics in the erotic divisions did not need to be replaced, as they were returned to their previous state (through their deconstruction and reconstruction, reutilizing the filth as a material for alchemy). 

High ranking manipulators were allowed to skip the long waiting times for a room, as they had several exclusive to them. These were supplied with the most handsome and well-endowed men and women, usually at least half of them being manipulators (not much could be done about that, as most participants were "customers" - non-manipulators were allowed into private rooms if their main user was already present).

As Dibalt approached the front desk, he was greeted by a pleasant-looking woman (the receptionist), which he remembered seeing in one of the rooms. *Yenni, was it?* "Yenni! Long time no see! You working as a concierge here?" *Please let it be the right name...*

"General! It's *quite* good to see you... Did you enjoy yourself?"

"Yes, my dear, it was quite enjoyable; impeccable service as always!"

"Why, thank you! We do try *really* " - she elongated the word while looking, longingly, at the general - "hard to please." - she finished by slowly and slightly leaning forward to show more of her already quite revealing cleavage. Dibalt couldn't help but nurture a predatorial appetite for the oh so delicious Yen. Just remembering the meal she would be (again) was enough to make him want a more... private session.

"Yes, I can *see* that! Listen, do you have someone who can cover for you?"

Yen leaned back in her chair, satisfied with the effect her body had on the general. "Sadly, no. Everyone else is busy, and I need to deal with the other customers... Maybe later, though?" 

Dibalt was distraught with the sudden blockade he was facing. "Unfortunately, I have a big assignment later today, so I won't be able to make it." - Yen's shoulders sunk a little - "When I come back, however, I'm sure I could spare a couple of days..." - A sly smile formed on his lips, returning his appetite, looking at Yen like a wolf to sheep. She, too, was making a face that was just waiting to be devoured.

"Sounds *quite* good to me. Well then, I won't hold you any longer... I'm sure you have important things to attend to. Have a nice day, General."

"You too, Yen." - The usage of her nickname by the General flattered her, making her blush, just a little. He turned away, walking towards the exit and past line coming towards the reception desk.

A man in the line, pointed angrily at Dibalt (probably not knowing who he was), almost shouting - "Hey! How come he doesn't have to present his badge?" - badges were used to identify the Void power one controlled, to ease the distribution of people among the rooms.

Dibalt stopped moving and slowly turned towards the idiot.

"Do you know who I am, child?"

"Who you are is irrelevant! *Everyone* must present their badge when they come here!"

Dibalt couldn't help but laugh at the man. "Why are you laughing at me?!"

"Let me show you why I don't have to wear a badge." - Dibalt looked at the man's badge - "Oh wow, you are a high-level manipulator, huh? Guess I should be scared!" - he chuckled a little, as people in line backed away from the man.

"Yes, you should! I am one of the strongest in the rankings!" - the man said, proudly.

"Mr. One-of-the-strongest, do you know why there are private rooms, and why, despite your ranking, you still aren't given access to them?" - The silence was all the answers Dibalt needed - "It is because if certain, select people were to be in the rankings, barely anyone would be able to reach the top. Let me show you. *Kneel*" - As he said so, the man did kneel, without any control over his actions, looking scared at the General.

"What is going on? I can't move!" - the man shouted, panicking.

"*Silence*" - attempt as he did, the man couldn't speak. - "I am Dibalt, a General, and not even the strongest manipulator in the city." - he raised his right hand, lifting the man in the air with it, without touching him, and flung him towards the end of the line.

The man landed, breaking some of his bones in the process. Dibalt slowly walked towards him, all the eyes in the crowd looking at the broken man. He started crawling away, but he felt himself being pulled by the General. Floating in the air once more, he was at the mercy of Dibalt. He attempted to break free with his Void powers, but the sheer pressure of the control Dibalt used wholly suppressed him.

This time, however, it was different. Dibalt used his power to mend the broken bones, leaving only bruises on the man's body. He then let him fall on the floor, releasing his control over the idiot. Dibalt approached him until he was only a few centimeters away. 

"Next time, I won't be so lenient." - Dibalt twirled his finger, making the man turn around to face the building. Tapping him in the back, he said - "Now go and have fun, and perhaps train your power." - Dibalt then left, leaving behind a man with his pants stained both in the front and back, releasing a foul smell in the air.

Dibalt reached the Council House. As he entered it, the male receptionist asked, "Do you have an appointment, general
?"

"No. Just tell my brother I'm here."

"Very well, sir."

While waiting for the councilman, he wandered around the richly decorated reception hall. He couldn't help but think about the resources wasted on making that building look beautiful. *What could we have achieved with those lost hours?". A man teleported in front of him.

"Brother." 

"My lord." - Dibalt said, mockingly.

"You know that shit annoys me to no end."

"I'm sorry, sir." 

"Oh, you little cunt..." - both burst into laughter and hugged each other.

The duo followed the receptionist into a private room he arranged for them. As quickly as he led them to the room, he closed the door for the two to be alone.

Dibalt flicked a switch next to the door. "It's better if this isn't heard by anyone outside. So, who am I taking to meet that monster?"

His brother looked almost afraid to answer, taking a while to respond to Dibalt. "You're not going to like it, but she's our best option."

"No, not Karyssa... not that nutcase... Seriously, she just doesn't stop... She once tried to make a dragon and almost killed the whole squad..."

"I know, I read the reports. But that's precisely why she is so crucial to this mission. You know how easily she calms down and tames void beasts; plus, should anything go wrong, just make her summon a dragon and let them fight each other."

Dibalt grunted and asked, "Who else will be going with us?"

"Megi and Trea."

"See, those I can agree with. Those two are the best scout and healer I've ever had the pleasure to work with."

"But then again, Karyssa is the best life alchemist you ever worked with. She knows how these beasts work; if she didn't, she wouldn't be able to alchemize them. You need her not only for escaping but also for reaching an agreement with the beast."

"If she doesn't annoy it trying to study it."

"Why do you think you're there?" - The councilman said, mockingly, and both laughed.

"So, when am I leaving?" 

"Later tonight. I'm having you all assembled here, in this very room, where we will give them all the details. Right away, you will leave. The journey there should only take you a week or so."

"Alright man." - Dibalt leaned forward with his right hand and, in it, formed a bottle of whiskey. - "It took me quite awhile to learn this trick, and a lot of money to buy enough bottles of these - and some hangovers too" - both laughed - "might as well use it to make a toast." 

In his left hand, Dibalt alchemized two whiskey glasses. He immediately poured some in both of them and handed one to his brother. They both raised their glasses, silently toasting and drinking to the success of the general's endeavor.
