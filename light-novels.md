Here you can find all the light novels I'm currently working on. Their themes *can* vary wildly, so beware.

Each light novel can be accompanied by an **Expanded Universe** section, where further details about the story's universe are given.

If you wish to publish your writings here, you can contact me through the information present in the [About]({site.baseurl}/about/).

<!--
Each light novel will have it's own "World Building section", which will constantly be improved upon, which will define
the rules under which each the novel's world operates.

These can also be seen as an expansion to the story itself, or added lore to the world, which does not significantly affect the overall story or characters,
comparable to what characters in the story would see in a library in their world.

The purpose of that section, if existent, is to allow the story's universe to be expanded upon, without having to force that information through needless expositional
dialogue for a mere curiosity.

For example, you could see this in a story:

> The great Antioch was the saviour of Antiochland

As anecdotal as the example may be, Antioch and Antiochland do not have a significant role in the story, and will not be present in it (except maybe some references, like in the example),
but will probably make their way into the world building section. -->
